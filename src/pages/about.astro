        We help businesses find the right software — without the noise.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Finding the right SaaS tool shouldn't require hours of research, dozens of sales calls, and wading through paid placements disguised as reviews. But that's the reality for most business owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Search for "best project management software" and you'll find listicles that rank whoever pays the most at the top. Ask for demos and you'll spend your week on calls with salespeople who've never used their own product.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        PickStack takes a different approach. We focus on specific business types and use cases — not generic "top 10" lists that try to please everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we say "best property management software for small landlords," we mean it. We've researched the options, compared the features, and made recommendations based on what actually matters for that specific user.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency first: we earn affiliate commissions when you sign up for products through our links. This is how we fund our research.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the thing — our recommendations come first. We don't rank products higher because they pay better commissions. If a product is bad, we'll say so, even if we could make money recommending it.

      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        PickStack is built by a small team obsessed with helping businesses make better decisions. We're not a massive media company churning out SEO content — we're researchers who actually care about getting it right.
      </p>

      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
