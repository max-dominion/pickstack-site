    <div class="prose">
      <p class="text-xl text-slate-600 mb-8">
        How we research, evaluate, and recommend software — and how we stay honest about it.
      </p>

      <h2>Research Process</h2>
      <p>For every product we review, we follow a consistent research process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Hands-on testing</strong> — We sign up for free trials and test core features ourselves</li>
        <li><strong>Feature analysis</strong> — We document capabilities, limitations, and unique differentiators</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing breakdown</strong> — We analyze pricing tiers, hidden costs, and value for money</li>
        <li><strong>User feedback</strong> — We aggregate reviews from G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, and Reddit</li>
        <li><strong>Support evaluation</strong> — We test response times and help quality</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Rating System</h2>
      <p>We rate products on a 5-star scale across multiple criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Features (25%)</strong> — Does it do what it claims? Are key features well-implemented?</li>
        <li><strong>Ease of Use (25%)</strong> — How quickly can someone get started? Is the interface intuitive?</li>
        <li><strong>Value (25%)</strong> — Is the pricing fair for what you get? Are there hidden costs?</li>
        <li><strong>Support (15%)</strong> — How responsive and helpful is the support team?</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability (10%)</strong> — Is the product stable? What's their uptime track record?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>"Best For" Categories</h2>
      <p>
        We don't believe in one-size-fits-all recommendations. Every product has strengths and weaknesses, and what's perfect for one business might be wrong for another.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why we focus on "best for" categories: Best for small landlords. Best for enterprise. Best free option. Best for specific use cases.
      </p>

      <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We earn affiliate commissions from some products we recommend. This is how we fund our research. However:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commission rates <strong>never</strong> influence our rankings</li>
        <li>We recommend products even when they don't have affiliate programs</li>
        <li>We criticize products even when we have affiliate relationships</li>
        <li>All affiliate links are clearly disclosed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updates & Corrections</h2>
      <p>
        Software changes constantly. We commit to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reviewing and updating articles at least quarterly</li>
        <li>Clearly marking when articles were last updated</li>
        <li>Promptly correcting any errors readers report</li>
        <li>Noting significant product changes that affect our recommendations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Independence</h2>
      <p>
        We do not accept:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Payment for higher rankings</li>
        <li>Sponsored content disguised as reviews</li>
        <li>Editorial influence from vendors</li>
        <li>Free products in exchange for positive coverage</li>
      </ul>
