      <div class="prose">
        <p>PickStack.ai is a participant in various affiliate programs. This means that when you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase or sign up for a service, we may earn a commission at no additional cost to you.</p>

        <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
        <p>Our revenue comes primarily from affiliate commissions. When we recommend a product and you sign up through our link, the software company pays us a referral fee. This is standard practice across review and comparison sites.</p>

        <h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Affiliate relationships never influence our rankings or recommendations.</strong> We evaluate every tool on its merits — features, pricing, user feedback, and real-world performance.</li>
          <li><strong>We review tools that don't pay us commissions too.</strong> If a product is the best option for a use case, we'll recommend it regardless of whether we earn anything.</li>
          <li><strong>We clearly label affiliate links.</strong> You'll always know when a link is an affiliate link.</li>
          <li><strong>Our methodology is transparent.</strong> Read our <a href="/methodology">full methodology</a> to see exactly how we evaluate software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
        <p>Using our affiliate links costs you nothing extra. The price you pay is the same whether you use our link or go directly to the vendor's site. By using our links, you help support the research and editorial work that makes PickStack.ai possible.</p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how we evaluate products, we're happy to discuss. Transparency is a core value at PickStack.</p>
