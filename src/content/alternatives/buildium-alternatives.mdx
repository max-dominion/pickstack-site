Buildium is a capable property management platform, but at $58–$460/month it's not the right choice for every landlord. Here are the best alternatives depending on what you actually need.

## Who Should Look for Buildium Alternatives

- **Small landlords (1–10 units):** Buildium is overkill. TurboTenant or Stessa does 90% of what you need for free.
- **Large professional managers (200+ units):** AppFolio's AI automation and reporting may be a better investment.
- **Growing managers on a budget:** DoorLoop offers similar features at a lower price point.
- **Pure investors:** Stessa's financial tracking and tax prep beats Buildium's accounting for investor-focused landlords.

## The Alternatives

### 1. AppFolio — Best for 100+ Units

AppFolio requires a 50-unit minimum but offers more automation and AI features than Buildium at scale. If you're managing 100+ units and want AI-powered maintenance routing and leasing, AppFolio is worth the switch.

**Pricing:** ~$1.40–$3.00/unit/month (minimum ~$70/month)
**Best for:** Professional property management companies

### 2. TurboTenant — Best Free Alternative

If you're a small landlord and Buildium's price is the problem, TurboTenant is the answer. It handles listings, screening, rent collection, and maintenance for free. It doesn't have Buildium's accounting depth, but most small landlords don't need it.

**Pricing:** Free (landlord pays nothing)
**Best for:** 1–20 unit landlords

### 3. DoorLoop — Best Buildium Price Alternative

DoorLoop targets Buildium customers directly with similar features at a lower starting price. It has full accounting, owner portals, maintenance management, and tenant portals — all the things that make Buildium worth using — at a more competitive rate.

**Pricing:** From $59/month (more included features per dollar than Buildium)
**Best for:** Property managers who want Buildium-tier features without Buildium's price

### 4. Stessa — Best for Investor-Landlords

Stessa isn't a full property management platform, but for landlords who primarily care about financial visibility — income tracking, expense categorization, Schedule E prep — it's better than Buildium at a fraction of the cost. Pairs well with a simpler tool for tenant management.

**Pricing:** Free (Pro from $20/month)
**Best for:** Real estate investors tracking portfolio performance

## Choosing the Right Alternative

| If you... | Consider... |
|-----------|-------------|
| Manage 1–20 units | TurboTenant (free) |
| Need full accounting + reports | DoorLoop or AppFolio |
| Primarily want financial tracking | Stessa (free) |
| Manage 100+ units professionally | AppFolio |
| Want HOA-specific features | PayHOA or Buildium (stays) |

## Bottom Line

For most small landlords, **TurboTenant** is the most compelling Buildium alternative — it's free and handles day-to-day management well. For professional managers who need full accounting and reporting, **DoorLoop** or **AppFolio** are worth evaluating before renewing Buildium.
