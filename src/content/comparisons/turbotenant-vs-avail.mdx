If you're a small landlord looking for free property management software, these two names come up constantly: TurboTenant and Avail. Both are legitimately free for landlords (they monetize through tenant screening fees). But they're not identical.

Here's the real breakdown.

## The Bottom Line Upfront

- **TurboTenant** has more features, a better mobile app, and a more polished experience overall
- **Avail** (owned by Realtor.com) has superior state-specific lease templates and a stronger legal resource library
- Both charge tenants for screening; both offer ACH rent collection free

## Feature Breakdown

### Tenant Screening

TurboTenant partners with TransUnion for background and credit checks. Avail uses a similar setup. Both charge tenants $30–$45 for full screening reports. Quality is comparable — TurboTenant's reports are slightly more detailed.

**Winner: Slight edge to TurboTenant.**

### Lease Agreements

This is Avail's strongest feature. Avail offers attorney-reviewed, state-specific lease templates for all 50 states. TurboTenant has lease templates but they're more generic.

**Winner: Avail** — significantly better if you're building your lease from scratch.

### Rent Collection

Both offer free ACH rent collection. TurboTenant launched its own bank account feature in 2024, which lets landlords keep security deposits separate automatically. Avail's rent collection is solid but less feature-rich.

**Winner: TurboTenant** — the dedicated landlord account adds real value.

### Maintenance Requests

TurboTenant has a more robust maintenance tracking system with photo uploads, vendor management, and status tracking. Avail's is functional but basic.

**Winner: TurboTenant.**

### Mobile Experience

TurboTenant's mobile app is polished and full-featured. Avail's is functional but has historically lagged behind the web experience.

**Winner: TurboTenant.**

### Pricing for Landlords

Both are free for landlords. TurboTenant's paid tier ($15/month) adds lease e-signing and premium features. Avail's paid tier ($9/unit/month) is more expensive for multi-unit landlords.

**Winner: TurboTenant** — better value on the paid tier too.

## Who Should Choose Each

**Choose TurboTenant if you:**
- Want the most complete free platform
- Have multiple units
- Care about mobile access and modern UX
- Want a dedicated landlord bank account

**Choose Avail if you:**
- Need state-specific, attorney-reviewed lease templates
- Are in a state with complex landlord-tenant laws
- Value the Realtor.com ecosystem (listing on Realtor.com is built in)

## Our Verdict

For most small landlords, **TurboTenant** is the better choice. It does more for free, has a better app, and the landlord banking feature is genuinely useful for keeping security deposits compliant.

If you're in a legally complex state (California, New York, Illinois) and building your first lease from scratch, **Avail's** lease templates are worth the extra setup time.
