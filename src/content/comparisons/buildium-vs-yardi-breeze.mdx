Yardi is the giant of property management software — the enterprise platform used by some of the world's largest real estate companies. But enterprise pricing and complexity put traditional Yardi out of reach for most property managers. That's why Yardi launched **Yardi Breeze**: a lighter, more accessible product aimed at small-to-midsize operators.

**Buildium** has been the go-to for residential property managers for years. Polished, well-supported, and purpose-built for managing rental portfolios.

**Yardi Breeze** offers the Yardi pedigree at an affordable starting price, with a cleaner interface than classic Yardi Voyager — but carries some of the tradeoffs that come with a product still maturing in this market segment.

## Buildium Overview

Buildium is owned by RealPage and has been a leading residential property management platform since 2004. Its focus is on managing the core workflows of property management — leasing, rent collection, maintenance, owner reporting, and accounting — in an intuitive package.

### What Buildium Does Well

**Residential workflows are well-designed.** From listing syndication to digital lease signing, tenant screening, and online rent collection, Buildium's residential leasing pipeline is smooth and comprehensive.

**Owner portals impress clients.** Property managers using Buildium can provide their owner-clients with a dedicated portal showing real-time performance data, statements, and distributions — the kind of transparency that differentiates professional property managers.

**Accounting is solid.** Full general ledger, bank reconciliation, owner distributions, trust accounting, and 1099 e-filing are all included.

**Support is reliable.** Buildium consistently earns positive reviews for its customer support team — important when your business depends on the platform.

**Clean, modern interface.** Staff onboarding is relatively fast. The UX is intuitive enough that new team members can be productive within days.

### Where Buildium Falls Short

- Commercial property support is minimal.
- Customization options are more limited than enterprise solutions.
- Can feel expensive at larger unit counts.

## Yardi Breeze Overview

Yardi Breeze launched in 2018 as Yardi's answer to the growing small-to-midsize PM software market. It offers a simplified version of Yardi's property management capabilities at a price point accessible to independent property managers.

### What Yardi Breeze Does Well

**Commercial property is supported.** Yardi Breeze handles retail, office, and industrial units alongside residential — a differentiator Buildium simply can't match.

**The Yardi ecosystem is an upgrade path.** Companies that anticipate scaling into enterprise property management can start on Yardi Breeze and eventually migrate to Yardi Voyager without changing vendors. That continuity has real value.

**Accounting pedigree is strong.** Yardi has always been known for robust accounting, and Breeze inherits that DNA. Full GL, bank reconciliation, and financial reporting are well-executed.

**Pricing is competitive at mid-range unit counts.** The per-unit model works out to reasonable costs for portfolios in the 100–500 unit range.

**Resident and owner portals are functional.** Online rent payments, maintenance requests, and owner reporting are all covered.

### Where Yardi Breeze Falls Short

- The interface, while improved from classic Yardi, still feels less modern than Buildium.
- Support quality is more variable than Buildium — common complaint among users.
- Some features feel less polished or complete compared to mature Buildium equivalents.
- Setup and onboarding take more time and effort.
- Yardi Breeze Premier (their mid-tier with more features) commands a higher price.
