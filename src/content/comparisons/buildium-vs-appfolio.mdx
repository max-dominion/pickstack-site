Buildium and AppFolio are two of the most widely used professional property management platforms on the market — and they're often compared directly. Both handle the full range of property management needs: accounting, tenant management, owner portals, maintenance, and reporting.

But they target different types of operations, and the differences matter.

**Buildium** is built for growing property managers and community associations (HOAs). It's accessible at smaller scales ($55/month starting price) and offers strong HOA-specific features like violation tracking and board member portals.

**AppFolio** is built for larger, professional property management companies. It starts at $1.40 per unit/month (100-unit minimum billing) and includes more advanced features like AI leasing tools, bulk texting, and a more sophisticated accounting layer.

## Quick Verdict

| | Buildium | AppFolio |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Growing managers, HOAs, mixed portfolios | Professional PM companies, larger portfolios |
| **Starting price** | $55/month (Essential) | ~$140/month (100-unit minimum) |
| **HOA support** | ✅ Strong | ✅ Good (fewer HOA-specific features) |
| **Accounting** | Good | Excellent |
| **AI features** | Limited | Yes (AppFolio Intelligence) |
| **Free trial** | Yes (14 days) | Demo only |
| **Affiliate program** | Yes (25% recurring) | No |

**Choose Buildium if:** You're growing, managing HOAs, or need an accessible starting point with HOA-specific tooling.

**Choose AppFolio if:** You're a professional PM company at 200+ units and need enterprise-grade accounting and AI leasing.

## Buildium Overview

Buildium was founded in 2004 and acquired by RealPage in 2019. It's designed for professional property managers handling residential portfolios and community associations, with a pricing model that makes sense at smaller scales.

### What Buildium Does Well

**HOA and community association management is first-class.** Buildium includes violation tracking with photo documentation, owner/board portals, budget and reserve tracking, architectural request workflows, and meeting document storage. For community managers, these aren't add-ons — they're core.

**Pricing scales reasonably.** The Essential plan starts at $55/month for up to 150 units. This is significantly more accessible than AppFolio for managers under 200 units.

**Resident and owner portals are well-built.** Tenants submit maintenance requests, pay rent, and view their ledger. Owners review financials and approve work orders. Both are included on all tiers.

**The 14-day free trial** lets you actually test the platform before committing — something AppFolio doesn't offer.

### Where Buildium Falls Short

- Accounting doesn't match AppFolio's depth for complex portfolios.
- No AI leasing or AI-driven maintenance triage.
- Bulk communication tools are less sophisticated than AppFolio's.

## AppFolio Overview

AppFolio launched in 2006 and has become one of the dominant platforms for professional property management companies. Its recent product push has focused heavily on AI-powered features under the "AppFolio Intelligence" brand.

### What AppFolio Does Well

**Accounting is enterprise-grade.** AppFolio's general ledger, multi-entity reporting, and financial consolidation capabilities are among the best in the market.

**AI-powered leasing.** AppFolio's AI leasing assistant handles inquiries, schedules showings, and qualifies prospects 24/7. For high-volume managers, this reduces leasing team workload meaningfully.

**AI maintenance triage** categorizes and routes incoming maintenance requests before a human sees them.

**Reporting depth** is exceptional. Custom report builder, owner-specific reporting packages, and financial dashboards are more configurable than Buildium.

### Where AppFolio Falls Short

- **100-unit minimum billing** at $1.40/unit/month means the floor is ~$140/month. Smaller managers pay a lot per unit.
- **No publisher affiliate program** — AppFolio sells direct.
- **No free trial** — you get a demo, not hands-on access.
- HOA-specific features are less developed than Buildium's.
- AI features add cost (AppFolio Intelligence pricing is separate).

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### HOA & Community Association Management

**Winner: Buildium** — Violation tracking, board portals, architectural requests, and budget/reserve management are purpose-built. AppFolio supports community associations but with fewer HOA-specific workflows.

### Accounting

**Winner: AppFolio** — For complex, multi-entity, or high-volume portfolios, AppFolio's accounting is deeper and more configurable.

### Pricing Accessibility

**Winner: Buildium** — The $55/month Essential plan is practical for managers at any size. AppFolio's 100-unit minimum is impractical for smaller portfolios.

### AI Features

**Winner: AppFolio** — AppFolio Intelligence includes leasing AI, maintenance triage AI, and more. Buildium doesn't currently offer comparable AI tooling.

### Ease of Getting Started

**Winner: Buildium** — Free trial, lower starting price, and a more accessible onboarding process.

**AppFolio wins at enterprise scale** — for professional PM companies at 200+ units who need sophisticated accounting, AI leasing automation, and advanced reporting.

For community association managers specifically, Buildium is the clearer recommendation.
