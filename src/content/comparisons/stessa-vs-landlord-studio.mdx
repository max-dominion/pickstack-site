If you're a do-it-yourself landlord managing a handful of rental properties, you don't need enterprise property management software. What you need is a clean, accurate way to track income and expenses — ideally one that makes tax season bearable.

Both **Stessa** and **Landlord Studio** were built with exactly this use case in mind. They're both focused on financial tracking, both have mobile apps, and both have free plans. But they take different approaches.

**Stessa** leans into portfolio analytics and tax reporting. It's built for landlords who think like investors — tracking NOI, cash-on-cash return, and preparing Schedule E without an accountant.

**Landlord Studio** focuses on clean, simple tracking. It's more straightforward, with a stronger mobile-first experience and a tenant management layer that Stessa doesn't prioritize.

## Stessa Overview

Stessa was founded by real estate investors who were frustrated by the lack of good financial tracking tools for landlords. Acquired by Roofstock in 2022, it's now part of the leading online real estate investment marketplace ecosystem.

### What Stessa Does Well

**Portfolio analytics are genuinely powerful.** Track net operating income, cash-on-cash return, cap rate, and occupancy at the portfolio and property level. Stessa calculates these automatically from your transaction data — no spreadsheets required.

**Tax prep is the best in class.** Stessa generates a Schedule E Worksheet ready for your accountant. It tracks income, expenses, and depreciation by property. Stessa Pro adds 1099 e-filing. If you have multiple properties and dread April, Stessa is likely worth it on tax prep alone.

**Bank connection and auto-categorization are excellent.** Connect your bank accounts, credit cards, and mortgage accounts. Stessa auto-categorizes the vast majority of transactions correctly — assigning them to the right property and expense category. Manual cleanup is minimal.

**The free plan is genuinely generous.** Unlimited properties, unlimited transactions, tax package prep, and financial reporting are all free.

### Where Stessa Falls Short

- No native banking (you connect existing accounts).
- Rent collection is powered by a third party — less seamless than native solutions.
- Tenant management is basic. Stessa isn't really a tenant management tool.
- The mobile experience is functional but not as polished as Landlord Studio.

## Landlord Studio Overview

Landlord Studio is a New Zealand-based company that's gained strong traction in the US and UK DIY landlord market. It combines financial tracking with lightweight tenant management in a mobile-first package.

### What Landlord Studio Does Well

**Mobile app is excellent.** Landlord Studio's iOS and Android apps are consistently rated among the best in the category. Capturing receipts, logging expenses, and reviewing financials on the go feels natural.

**Tenant management is more complete than Stessa.** Landlord Studio includes tenant contact management, lease tracking, rent reminders, and maintenance requests — a more complete day-to-day management toolkit.

**Simple onboarding.** Many users report being fully set up within an hour. The simplicity is a selling point for landlords who don't want to learn complex software.

**Receipt scanning** lets you photograph paper receipts and attach them to expense records directly from your phone.

**Reporting covers the basics.** Income statements, expense breakdowns, and property summaries are clean and easy to share with an accountant.

### Where Landlord Studio Falls Short

- Free plan is limited to 3 properties — restrictive for anyone with a growing portfolio.
- Portfolio analytics are significantly less developed than Stessa's.
- Tax reporting is less comprehensive — no Schedule E worksheet comparable to Stessa.
- Auto-categorization is less accurate than Stessa's bank connection logic.
