Buildium and PayHOA both serve HOA communities, but they come from completely different worlds.

**Buildium** is a full-scale property management platform that added HOA features. It handles everything from accounting to maintenance to online payments — but it's built for professional property managers running multiple communities (and often rental properties too).

**PayHOA** is built exclusively for homeowner associations. It's designed for volunteer board members, not professional managers. Dues collection, violation tracking, community communication — all simplified for people who aren't doing this full-time.

The right choice depends on who's running your community and how complex your needs are.

## Quick Verdict

| | Buildium | PayHOA |

| **Starting price** | ~$58/month (Essential) | Free for basic; ~$49/month for full features |
| **Online payments** | Yes (ACH + credit card) | Yes (ACH + credit card) |
| **Accounting** | Full double-entry | Simplified ledger |
| **Violation tracking** | Yes | Yes |

| **Community portal** | Yes | Yes |
| **Document storage** | Yes | Yes |
| **Board member tools** | Limited | Excellent (built for boards) |
| **Rental management** | Yes | No |

**Choose Buildium if:** You use a management company, handle multiple communities, or need enterprise accounting.

**Choose PayHOA if:** Your board self-manages and needs simple, affordable tools for dues and communication.

## Where Buildium Wins

### Professional-Grade Accounting
Buildium offers full double-entry accounting with a general ledger, customizable chart of accounts, and detailed financial reporting. It generates balance sheets, income statements, and budget-vs-actual reports that professional accountants expect.

PayHOA's accounting is simplified — designed for board treasurers, not CPAs. It handles income/expense tracking and basic reporting, but it's not a full accounting system.

### Multi-Community & Mixed Portfolio
If your management company handles 5 HOAs, 50 rental units, and a few commercial properties, Buildium manages all of that in one platform. It's the only tool in this comparison that handles both HOA and rental property management.

PayHOA is single-community focused. You can manage multiple communities on separate accounts, but there's no unified multi-site dashboard.

### Maintenance Management
Buildium includes a full work order system — residents submit requests through a portal, managers assign vendors, track costs, and close tickets. This matters for communities with common-area maintenance responsibilities.

PayHOA offers basic maintenance request tracking but lacks the vendor management and work order workflow that Buildium provides.

### Vendor & 1099 Management
Buildium tracks vendor payments and generates 1099 forms at year-end. For communities paying landscapers, pool services, and maintenance crews, this eliminates a significant bookkeeping headache.

PayHOA doesn't offer vendor management or 1099 tracking.

## Where PayHOA Wins

### Designed for Board Members
PayHOA is built for volunteer board members who have day jobs. The interface is clean and intuitive — you don't need property management experience to navigate it. Setup takes minutes, not hours.

Buildium is powerful but complex. It's designed for professional managers and has a learning curve that can frustrate volunteer boards.

### Violation Tracking
PayHOA's violation management is excellent — document violations with photos, send automated notices through customizable workflows, track resolution timelines, and maintain a complete compliance history. This is a common pain point for HOAs that PayHOA handles particularly well.

Buildium offers violation tracking too, but PayHOA's workflow is more intuitive for boards.

### Pricing for Small Communities
PayHOA offers a free tier for basic features and a full-featured plan starting around $49/month. For a 50-unit community, that's under $1 per unit per month.

Buildium starts at $58/month (Essential plan) and scales up with unit count. For the same 50-unit community with the features you actually need, you're likely paying $100+/month.

### Community Communication
PayHOA includes built-in email blasts, announcements, and a community portal where residents access documents, pay dues, and submit requests. It's simple and works.

Buildium has a resident portal too, but PayHOA's communication tools feel more like a community platform and less like a property management back office.

## The Cost Question

### Buildium
- **Essential:** ~$58/month (up to 20 units)
- **Growth:** ~$183/month (up to 20 units, adds features)
- **Premium:** ~$375/month (unlimited units, open API)
- Per-unit pricing increases with community size

### PayHOA
- **Free:** Basic features for small communities
- **Standard:** ~$49/month (most features)
- **Premium:** ~$79/month (full features including website builder)
- Flat pricing regardless of community size (some tiers)

For a self-managed 100-unit community, PayHOA typically costs 40-60% less than Buildium with comparable core features. The gap narrows for larger, professionally managed communities where Buildium's advanced accounting and multi-site tools justify the price.

## When to Choose Each

### Choose Buildium if:
- A management company runs your community
- You manage multiple HOAs (or HOAs + rentals)
- You need full double-entry accounting and financial reporting
- You have complex maintenance operations with multiple vendors
- You're processing 1099s for service providers

### Choose PayHOA if:
- Your board self-manages (no property manager)
- You primarily need dues collection and communication
- You want something a volunteer treasurer can use immediately
- Budget is a concern and you need lower per-unit costs
- You want purpose-built HOA tools, not adapted property management software

---

## The Bottom Line

**Buildium** is the better platform — in the sense that it does more. Full accounting, maintenance management, vendor tracking, multi-site support, and rental property management make it the complete solution for professionally managed communities.

**PayHOA** is the better fit for most self-managed HOAs. It does the things boards actually need — collect dues, communicate with residents, track violations — without the complexity and cost of enterprise property management software.

If your board runs the show, start with PayHOA. If you hire a management company (or plan to), ask them about Buildium.
