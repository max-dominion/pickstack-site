If you're a landlord trying to pick between Stessa and Baselane, you're actually looking at two different tools that happen to overlap in one area: tracking rental income.

**Stessa** is a portfolio management and financial tracking platform. It's built for investors who want clear visibility into property performance, clean expense reports, and painless Schedule E tax prep.

**Baselane** is a landlord banking platform first, property manager second. It gives you a real business bank account with rent collection, expense tracking, and basic bookkeeping baked in.

Both are free (with paid tiers). Both connect to your bank accounts. But they solve different problems — and the right choice depends on which problem matters more to you.

## Quick Verdict

| | Stessa | Baselane |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Tracking, reporting, and taxes | Banking + rent collection |
| **Free plan** | Yes | Yes |
| **Paid tier** | Stessa Pro (~$20/month) | Baselane Plus (~$15/month) |

| **Rent collection** | Yes (via partner) | Yes (native, ACH + credit card) |
| **Tax reports** | Excellent (Schedule E ready) | Basic |
| **Mobile app** | Good | Good |

**Choose Stessa if:** You want the best financial visibility and easiest tax prep.

**Choose Baselane if:** You want an all-in-one banking account built specifically for rental income.

## Stessa Overview

Stessa was built by real estate investors and acquired by Roofstock in 2022. Its core promise: give landlords the same financial clarity that professional property managers have, for free.

### What Stessa Does Well

**Financial tracking is unmatched.** Connect your bank accounts, mortgage accounts, and credit cards. Stessa auto-categorizes every transaction — mortgage payments, repairs, insurance, management fees — and assigns them to the right property. Most transactions get correctly categorized without any manual intervention.

**Tax time is actually painless.** Stessa generates a Schedule E Worksheet ready for your accountant or TurboTax import. It also supports 1099 e-filing (Stessa Pro) and tracks depreciation. If you dread tax season, this alone is worth it.

**Portfolio analytics are genuinely useful.** Net operating income, cash-on-cash return, cap rate, occupancy rate — Stessa calculates these automatically from your transaction data. You can benchmark properties side by side and spot underperformers without building spreadsheets.

**The free plan is genuinely generous.** Unlimited properties, unlimited transactions, income and expense tracking, tax package prep — all free. Stessa Pro adds e-filing, lease tracking, and a few reporting upgrades for around $20/month.

### Where Stessa Falls Short

- No native banking. You connect external accounts rather than moving money through Stessa.
- Rent collection is powered by a third party (not as seamless as native solutions).
- Tenant management features are minimal — this isn't a full property management suite.
- Not designed for professional property managers handling dozens of doors.

## Baselane Overview

Baselane launched in 2020 with a thesis: landlords deserve a real banking product, not just a tracking tool. It offers FDIC-insured checking accounts, virtual cards, and an integrated payment layer — all wrapped in a dashboard that understands rental income.

### What Baselane Does Well

**The banking experience is built for landlords.** Unlike connecting a Chase or Wells Fargo account to a tracker, Baselane gives you actual business banking with features landlords actually need: separate virtual accounts per property, automatic rent collection via ACH, and payment categorization that maps to real estate expense categories.

**Rent collection is native and frictionless.** Tenants pay online. The money lands in your Baselane account. The transaction is automatically tagged to the right property and expense category. It's cleaner than Stessa's third-party rent collection integration.

**Virtual cards per property** mean you can issue a dedicated card to each property for expenses, keeping everything cleanly separated without manual allocation.

**High-yield savings** on your rental reserves earns a competitive APY — a meaningful benefit if you're sitting on security deposits or capital reserves.

**The free tier is competitive.** Unlimited banking, unlimited rent collection, and basic tracking are free. Baselane Plus unlocks advanced reporting and additional features.

### Where Baselane Falls Short

- Financial reporting is less detailed than Stessa. Schedule E prep is less polished.
- No deep portfolio analytics — cap rate, cash-on-cash return, NOI dashboards aren't as well-developed.
- The "software" side of the platform is thinner than Stessa; Baselane is a bank that also does tracking, not the reverse.
- Customer support has had mixed reviews at scale.

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### Financial Tracking

**Winner: Stessa**

Stessa was built from the ground up as a tracking tool. Transaction auto-categorization is more accurate, the chart of accounts maps better to real estate accounting, and the reporting suite is significantly more comprehensive. Baselane's tracking is good for basic income/expense logging but doesn't match Stessa's depth.

### Tax Reporting

**Winner: Stessa**

This isn't close. Stessa's Schedule E worksheet, depreciation tracking, and 1099 e-filing (Pro) make tax prep straightforward. Baselane covers the basics but doesn't offer the same tax-specific reporting Stessa does.

### Banking

**Winner: Baselane**

Stessa doesn't offer banking at all — you connect accounts. Baselane gives you an actual FDIC-insured account, virtual property cards, high-yield savings, and wire/ACH transfers. If having a dedicated landlord bank account matters to you, Baselane wins this by default.

### Rent Collection

**Winner: Baselane**

Both platforms support online rent collection, but Baselane's is native and tightly integrated with its banking layer. Money collected goes directly into your Baselane account, already categorized. Stessa's rent collection is handled through a third-party integration, creating more friction.

### Portfolio Analytics

**Winner: Stessa**

Stessa's property-level and portfolio-level analytics dashboards are genuinely useful for investors. Net yield, cap rate, occupancy, and expense ratios are calculated automatically. Baselane doesn't match this depth.

### Ease of Use

**Tie**

Both have clean, modern interfaces. Stessa's onboarding centers on connecting accounts and classifying transactions; Baselane's centers on setting up banking and inviting tenants. Neither requires technical expertise.

### Pricing

| Plan | Stessa | Baselane |
|------|--------|----------|
| Free | Unlimited properties, tracking, tax package | Banking, rent collection, basic tracking |
| Paid | ~$20/month (Pro) | ~$15/month (Plus) |

Both offer strong free tiers. Baselane's paid tier is slightly cheaper; Stessa's adds more value for tax-focused users.

## Who Should Choose Stessa?

✅ **Real estate investors who care about portfolio performance** — Stessa's analytics and reporting are built for people thinking about ROI, cap rates, and long-term value creation.

✅ **Landlords who dread tax season** — If you hate sorting through transactions every April, Stessa's automated categorization and Schedule E worksheet will save you hours.

✅ **Landlords who already have a preferred bank** — If you're happy with your existing bank, Stessa lets you keep it while adding powerful tracking on top.

✅ **Portfolio owners with 5+ properties** — The more properties you own, the more Stessa's comparative analytics matter.

---

## Who Should Choose Baselane?

✅ **Landlords who want everything in one banking account** — If you've been using a personal account or generic business account for rental income, switching to Baselane's landlord-purpose account is a meaningful upgrade.

✅ **Landlords focused on cash flow** — Baselane's rent collection and automatic categorization make tracking cash flow simpler when money is moving through one system.

✅ **Landlords who want virtual cards per property** — The ability to issue a separate card for each property makes expense separation easy and audit-proof.

✅ **New landlords setting up their financial infrastructure** — Baselane is an excellent starting point if you're building systems from scratch.

---

## Can You Use Both?

Yes — and many landlords do. Use Baselane for banking and rent collection (the money movement), and connect your Baselane account to Stessa for deeper tracking and tax reporting.

This is arguably the best setup: Baselane handles the banking and payments cleanly; Stessa handles the financial intelligence layer. The only downside is maintaining two platforms, but both have free tiers so cost isn't a barrier.

---

## Final Verdict

**Stessa wins overall** for most landlords — particularly investors who want meaningful financial insights and clean tax reporting. Its tracking depth, portfolio analytics, and tax prep tools are best-in-class among free options.

**Baselane wins** if your primary need is landlord banking and you want rent collection, expense cards, and reserves in one account. It's not just a tracker — it's a financial infrastructure platform for rental businesses.

**Best combo:** Use Baselane for banking + rent collection, connect to Stessa for tracking and analytics.
