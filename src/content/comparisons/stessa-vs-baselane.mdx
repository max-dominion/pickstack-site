Both Stessa and Baselane aim to solve the same problem: landlords have terrible financial tooling. QuickBooks is overkill. Spreadsheets are a nightmare. These two platforms were built specifically for rental property owners — and both are free to start.

But they take very different approaches. Here's what you need to know.

## Quick Overview

**Stessa** started as a portfolio tracking tool for real estate investors. It focuses on income/expense tracking, NOI reporting, and Schedule E tax prep. It now includes rent collection and banking, but its core identity is analytics and reporting.

**Baselane** started as a landlord banking platform. It offers a free FDIC-insured bank account, debit card, and automated bookkeeping. Rent collection and expense tracking are built around the bank account.

## Feature Comparison

### Income & Expense Tracking

Both platforms automatically categorize transactions once you connect your accounts. Stessa has a slight edge here — its categorization is more granular and tax-aware (it maps directly to Schedule E line items). Baselane is solid but more generic.

**Winner: Stessa** — purpose-built for tax-time accuracy.

### Rent Collection

Both offer free ACH rent collection. Baselane includes it natively (renters pay into your Baselane account). Stessa added rent collection later — it works, but feels like a secondary feature.

**Winner: Baselane** — rent collection is seamlessly integrated with the bank account.

### Banking

Baselane offers a genuine landlord bank account with virtual cards, high-yield savings, and cashback on property purchases. Stessa has a basic banking product but it's not the focus.

**Winner: Baselane** — purpose-built landlord banking is their differentiator.

### Reporting & Analytics

Stessa's dashboards are best-in-class for rental portfolio analytics: net operating income, cash-on-cash return, occupancy rates, and tax reports. Baselane's reporting is functional but basic by comparison.

**Winner: Stessa** — the original reason people love it.

### Pricing

Both are free for core features. Stessa Pro starts at $20/month (adds unlimited transaction accounts, premium reports, smart receipts). Baselane is free with no paid tier — revenue comes from their banking products.

**Winner: Tie** — both free to start, different premium models.

## Who Should Use Each

**Choose Stessa if you:**
- Have multiple properties and want portfolio-level reporting
- Do your own taxes and care about Schedule E accuracy
- Want the best analytics dashboard for tracking performance

**Choose Baselane if you:**
- Want a dedicated landlord bank account
- Prefer everything in one place (banking + rent collection + bookkeeping)
- Don't want to think about separate accounts or apps

## Our Recommendation

For most small landlords managing 1–10 units, **Stessa** is the better starting point for financial tracking. Its reporting is genuinely excellent and the free tier is generous.

If you're willing to switch your banking, **Baselane** offers an all-in-one solution that eliminates the need for multiple apps. The landlord bank account with cashback on expenses is a compelling reason to switch.

Many landlords use both: Baselane for banking and rent collection, Stessa for reporting and tax prep.
