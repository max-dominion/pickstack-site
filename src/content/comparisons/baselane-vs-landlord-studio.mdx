Baselane and Landlord Studio are frequently compared by independent landlords looking for a better way to manage their rental property finances. They both track rental income and expenses. They both have mobile apps. But they represent fundamentally different approaches.

**Baselane** is a banking product. It gives you an FDIC-insured business account purpose-built for rental income — with rent collection, property-specific virtual cards, high-yield savings, and expense categorization baked in.

**Landlord Studio** is a tracking product. It connects to your existing bank accounts and gives you a clean interface to log income, track expenses, manage leases, and generate basic reports — all without moving your money.

The choice between them often comes down to one question: do you want to change where your money lives, or just how you track it?

## Baselane Overview

Baselane launched in 2020 with the thesis that landlords deserve real banking infrastructure — not just software bolted onto generic bank accounts.

### What Baselane Does Well

**Landlord banking is the core product.** Baselane offers FDIC-insured checking accounts with features landlords actually need: virtual property cards (one per property for clean expense separation), ACH rent collection, and automatic transaction categorization using real estate expense categories.

**Rent collection is native.** Tenants pay online, money lands in your Baselane account, and the transaction is automatically tagged to the right property. No third-party payment processor middleman.

**Virtual cards per property** mean you can issue a dedicated debit card to each property. Property 1's repair expenses go on Property 1's card — zero manual allocation.

**High-yield savings** on your reserves earns a competitive APY. Meaningful if you're holding security deposits or capital reserves.

**Free banking** — the core banking product is free. You pay only if you upgrade to Baselane Plus for advanced features.

### Where Baselane Falls Short

- You have to actually move money to Baselane for the system to work. That's a friction point for landlords happy with their current bank.
- Financial analytics are less developed than Stessa or even Landlord Studio's reporting.
- Tenant management features are minimal.
- Customer support has had scalability issues as the user base grew.

## Landlord Studio Overview

Landlord Studio offers a clean mobile-first experience for tracking rental property income and expenses. It's built for landlords who want to stay organized and generate basic reports without the complexity of full property management software.

### What Landlord Studio Does Well

**Mobile experience is class-leading.** The iOS and Android apps are consistently rated among the best for rental property management. Logging expenses, scanning receipts, and reviewing financials from your phone is genuinely fast.

**No banking change required.** Connect your existing bank accounts, or simply log transactions manually. Landlord Studio works with whatever financial setup you already have.

**Tenant management is more complete than Baselane.** Lease tracking, rent reminders, tenant contact management, and maintenance request handling are all included.

**Simple and fast to set up.** Many users are fully configured within an hour. The onboarding is designed for landlords who aren't software-savvy.

**Receipt scanning** lets you capture paper receipts on your phone and attach them directly to expense records — no desktop required.

### Where Landlord Studio Falls Short

- Free plan is capped at 3 properties — restrictive for growing portfolios.
- Auto-categorization is less accurate than Baselane's banking-native approach.
- No portfolio-level investment analytics.
- Tax reporting is basic — no Schedule E worksheet comparable to Stessa.

---

## Final Verdict

**Baselane wins** if you're willing to use it as your banking home base. The automated tracking, native rent collection, and property-specific virtual cards deliver real operational value — especially if you're just setting up your financial systems.

**Landlord Studio wins** if you want clean, mobile-first tracking without changing your banking setup. The better mobile app and tenant management features are genuine advantages for hands-on landlords.

The key question: are you willing to move your rental money to Baselane? If yes, Baselane is almost certainly the better all-in-one system. If no, Landlord Studio is an excellent tracking layer on top of whatever you're already using.
