If you're running a higher-end salon or spa and have outgrown the generic booking tools, the shortlist usually comes down to two names: Mangomint and Boulevard.

Both target the premium segment of the salon software market. Both have modern interfaces that feel nothing like the legacy platforms most stylists grew up using. Both have excellent reviews.

The distinction is in who they're built for: **Mangomint** is optimized for boutique salons, spas, and independent studios — fast, elegant, and priced fairly for 1–10 staff. **Boulevard** is built for scaling operations — multi-staff salons, medspas, and businesses that need serious CRM, automation, and eventually multi-location management.

## Quick Verdict

| | Mangomint | Boulevard |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Boutique salons and spas (1–10 staff) | Established salons, medspas, multi-location |
| **Starting price** | ~$165/month | ~$175/month |
| **Pricing model** | Per-location, unlimited staff above a threshold | Tiered by staff count |
| **CRM / client marketing** | Good | Excellent |
| **Memberships** | Yes | Advanced |
| **Medspa / EMR** | No | Yes (add-on) |
| **Multi-location** | Yes | Yes (stronger) |
| **Onboarding** | Fast, self-serve | More hands-on |
| **User reviews** | Industry-best UX ratings | Strong, with some complaint about price |

**Choose Mangomint if:** You run a boutique salon or spa, value a clean and fast user experience, and don't need medspa EMR functionality.

**Choose Boulevard if:** You're running a larger or growing operation, want advanced CRM and membership automation, or need medspa/EMR features.

## Mangomint Overview

Mangomint launched in 2018 and has become a favorite among boutique salons and spas that want modern software without enterprise complexity or enterprise pricing. It consistently tops industry rankings for user experience and customer satisfaction.

### What Mangomint Does Well

**The interface is the best in the business.** If you've ever complained that salon software feels dated, Mangomint is the antidote. Booking, scheduling, checkout — every flow is fast and intuitive. Staff can learn the system in hours, not days.

**Pricing is clear and fair for small-to-mid teams.** Mangomint's pricing model doesn't punish growth in the same way — their per-location structure with generous staff inclusions keeps costs predictable as you add providers.

**Smart checkout and Express Checkout** reduces front desk friction dramatically. Clients can check out from their phone; staff don't get stuck at the POS.

**Automated client communication** — confirmation, reminder, follow-up, and win-back sequences — is solid and easy to configure.

**Two-way texting with clients** is a standout feature: clients can reply to appointment reminders, and staff see the conversation in the platform.

**Reporting is clean and actionable** — service revenue, staff performance, client retention — presented without overwhelming complexity.

### Where Mangomint Falls Short

- **No medspa / EMR features.** If you're running a medspa with injectable services or require medical charting, Mangomint isn't the right tool.
- **CRM is good but not Boulevard-level.** For high-touch client segmentation and complex marketing automation, Boulevard has more depth.
- **Multi-location support** works but is stronger on Boulevard.

## Boulevard Overview

Boulevard launched in 2016 and targeted the premium salon segment from day one. It has raised significant venture funding and built a platform with genuine enterprise depth — CRM, membership management, medspa EMR (through integrations), and multi-location infrastructure.

### What Boulevard Does Well

**CRM and client segmentation are best-in-class.** Boulevard tracks client history, service preferences, product purchases, and visit cadence — and lets you create targeted campaigns based on that data. Want to message all clients who haven't visited in 90 days who historically book color services? Boulevard can do that.

**Membership management is sophisticated.** Recurring membership revenue — monthly billing, service packages, family plans — is a core capability. For salons building a membership model, Boulevard has more tools than anyone else at this price tier.

**Medspa / aesthetic clinic support.** Through integrations and their EMR module, Boulevard handles the clinical documentation requirements that medspas need — consent forms, treatment notes, before/after photos.

**Multi-location management** is a genuine strength. Boulevard was built with multi-location in mind from the start, with centralized reporting, staff management across locations, and consistent client profiles.

**The booking experience for clients is beautiful** — Boulevard's consumer booking interface is polished and on-brand.

### Where Boulevard Falls Short

- **Pricing is higher** and increases meaningfully with staff count. Can feel expensive for smaller teams.
- **Onboarding takes longer.** The system has more depth, which means more setup time.
- **Some users report steeper learning curve** for front desk staff.
- **Customer support response times** have been called out in reviews as inconsistent.

## Pricing Comparison

Both platforms are in a similar range but structure costs differently:

| | Mangomint | Boulevard |
|---|---|---|
| **Base price** | ~$165/month | ~$175/month |
| **Staff scaling** | More gradual | Increases faster per staff member |
| **Free trial** | 30-day free trial | Demo + trial |
| **Setup fee** | None | None |

For boutique operations (1–5 staff), Mangomint typically comes in cheaper or equivalent. For larger teams (10+ staff), Boulevard's per-staff pricing can become significant.

---

## Who Should Choose Mangomint?

✅ **Boutique salons and day spas (2–8 staff)** — The best user experience in the industry at a fair price for this team size.

✅ **Operations where front desk efficiency matters** — Express Checkout and two-way texting reduce front-of-house friction.

✅ **Salons switching from legacy software** — Mangomint's fast onboarding and clean UX make migration less painful.

✅ **Teams that don't need medspa EMR** — If you're a pure salon/spa (not a medspa with medical services), Mangomint has everything you need.

---

## Who Should Choose Boulevard?

✅ **Multi-staff salons (10+ providers) or multi-location operations** — Boulevard scales more robustly.

✅ **Medspas and aesthetic clinics** — EMR module and consent form management cover clinical needs.

✅ **Operations built around memberships** — If recurring membership revenue is central to your model, Boulevard's tools are more sophisticated.

✅ **Salons wanting deep client lifecycle marketing** — Segmented campaigns, automated win-back sequences, and revenue-by-segment analytics are Boulevard's strengths.

---

## Final Verdict

**Mangomint wins for most boutique salons and spas.** If you run a 1–8 provider operation that doesn't need medspa capabilities, Mangomint's combination of superior user experience, fair pricing, and excellent client communication tools makes it the best overall platform.

**Boulevard wins for larger operations and medspas.** If you're managing 10+ staff, running multiple locations, building a membership model, or operating a medspa with clinical documentation needs — Boulevard's depth pays off.

**The bottom line:** If your team is under 8 people and you don't do medical aesthetics, try Mangomint first. If you're scaling beyond that or need membership infrastructure, Boulevard is worth the price.
