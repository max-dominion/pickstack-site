Two of the most actively compared platforms in the independent landlord and small property manager market, **RentRedi** and **DoorLoop** are both modern, mobile-first applications that launched after 2016 — well after the old guard of property management software. Both do online rent collection, tenant screening, lease management, and maintenance tracking. Both have polished apps.

But they have meaningfully different positioning and pricing.

**RentRedi** is built for independent landlords who want a full PM toolkit without paying enterprise prices. Its flat-rate pricing makes it attractive for growing portfolios.

**DoorLoop** targets property managers and growing operations. It's more feature-complete, has better support, and handles portfolios with more complexity — but at a higher price point.

## Quick Verdict

| | RentRedi | DoorLoop |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Independent landlords, budget-conscious operators | Growing property managers, professional PM companies |
| **Starting price** | ~$20/month | ~$69/month (up to 20 units) |
| **Free trial** | No (30-day money back) | Yes (14 days) |
| **Pricing model** | Flat rate regardless of units | Per-unit tiers |
| **Mobile app** | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Tenant screening** | Yes (via TransUnion) | Yes |
| **Accounting** | Basic | Full GL |
| **Marketing/listings** | Yes | Yes |
| **Owner portals** | Yes | Yes |

**Choose RentRedi if:** You're an independent landlord who wants a full-featured PM app at a flat rate.

**Choose DoorLoop if:** You want a more complete platform with proper accounting, better support, and room to scale.

## RentRedi Overview

RentRedi launched in 2016 and has built a loyal user base among independent landlords. In 2023, it merged with TurboTenant (they now operate under the same parent), though both products continue to run independently.

### What RentRedi Does Well

**Flat-rate pricing is a genuine advantage.** RentRedi charges a flat monthly or annual fee regardless of how many units you manage. For growing portfolios, this means your costs don't scale with your doors.

**The mobile app is excellent.** RentRedi's iOS and Android apps are consistently well-reviewed. Managing maintenance requests, running tenant screening, and reviewing rent payments from your phone is seamless.

**Tenant screening via TransUnion** covers credit, criminal, and eviction history with competitive pricing.

**Online rent collection** with automated reminders, partial payments, and late fee handling is well-implemented.

**The pricing is hard to beat for landlords with many units.** A landlord managing 30 units pays the same flat rate as one managing 5 — at around $20/month, that math works out to under $1/unit.

### Where RentRedi Falls Short

- Accounting is basic. RentRedi tracks income and expenses but lacks full general ledger capabilities.
- Reporting is limited compared to DoorLoop.
- Owner portals are less polished — not ideal for professional property managers with owner-clients.
- Customer support has mixed reviews.
- DoorLoop's feature depth is meaningfully greater.

## DoorLoop Overview

DoorLoop launched in 2019 and has grown quickly, positioning itself as the modern, user-friendly alternative to legacy PM software like Buildium and AppFolio, while targeting the same market.

### What DoorLoop Does Well

**Feature depth is impressive.** DoorLoop's platform covers the full PM workflow: online listings, applications, tenant screening, digital leases, rent collection, maintenance management, owner portals, full accounting, and reporting — all in one well-designed interface.

**Accounting is proper GL.** DoorLoop offers a full general ledger with bank reconciliation, owner distributions, and detailed financial reporting. For property managers handling owner funds, this matters.

**Owner portals are polished.** DoorLoop's owner portal is one of the better ones in its price tier — useful for professional property managers presenting data to clients.

**Support quality is strong.** DoorLoop is consistently praised for responsive, knowledgeable support — a meaningful differentiator from RentRedi's more mixed reputation.

**The platform scales.** Whether you're managing 5 units or 500, DoorLoop's architecture accommodates growth.

### Where DoorLoop Falls Short

- Higher starting price ($69/month for up to 20 units) compared to RentRedi's flat fee.
- Per-unit pricing means costs scale with portfolio growth.
- Still a relatively young platform — some features less mature than Buildium or AppFolio.
- Overkill for landlords who just need basic rent collection and expense tracking.
