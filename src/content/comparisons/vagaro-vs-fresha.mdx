Vagaro and Fresha are two of the most popular salon booking platforms in the world — and they're almost always compared side by side. Both handle appointments, staff scheduling, client management, and payments. Both have free options. Both have millions of users.

But their fundamental business models are different in a way that changes everything about how they feel to use and what they actually cost.

**Vagaro** charges a flat monthly subscription fee based on the number of bookable staff. You know what you're paying every month.

**Fresha** has no subscription fee — instead, it charges a 20% commission on new clients acquired through the Fresha marketplace (not returning clients). That sounds free until you're acquiring a lot of new clients.

Understanding that distinction is the key to choosing between them.

## Quick Verdict

| | Vagaro | Fresha |
|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Full-service salons wanting all-in-one tools | Solo operators and studios prioritizing low monthly cost |
| **Monthly fee** | $30–$85/month | $0/month |
| **Transaction fees** | Processing fees only (2.75% swipe) | 20% on new marketplace clients; standard processing on others |

| **Marketing tools** | Advanced (email, SMS, campaigns) | Basic |
| **Staff management** | Yes | Yes |
| **Inventory management** | Yes | Yes |

**Choose Fresha if:** You're a solo operator or small studio with low new-client volume and want to minimize fixed monthly costs.

## Vagaro Overview

Vagaro has been in the salon software market since 2009 and now serves over 220,000 businesses in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia.

### What Vagaro Does Well

**The platform is genuinely comprehensive.** Vagaro covers appointment booking, POS, staff scheduling, payroll, inventory management, retail point-of-sale, email marketing, SMS marketing, reputation management, memberships, packages, gift cards, and client management — all in one place.

**Marketing tools are a differentiator.** Email campaigns, automated follow-ups, SMS marketing, and review management are significantly more sophisticated than Fresha's.

**Vagaro Marketplace** lists your business on Vagaro's consumer app, generating new client bookings without a percentage commission structure.

**Predictable pricing** means you know exactly what you're paying each month, regardless of how many new clients you acquire.

**Memberships and packages** — recurring revenue products — are well-implemented and easy to sell at checkout.

### Where Vagaro Falls Short

- Monthly subscription fee can feel expensive for solo operators.
- The interface has a slight learning curve compared to Fresha's clean simplicity.
- Processing rates (2.75% card present) aren't the lowest in the market.

## Fresha Overview

Fresha launched in 2015 and now serves over 100,000 businesses globally, with particularly strong penetration in the UK, Australia, and Europe.

### What Fresha Does Well

**Zero subscription fee is genuinely attractive.** For solo operators, booth renters, or small studios with tight margins, not paying $30–$90/month matters.

**The user experience is notably clean.** Fresha's interface is modern, intuitive, and fast. New staff can learn the basics in minutes.

**Global marketplace reach** is significant. Fresha's consumer marketplace surfaces nearby businesses to potential new clients worldwide.

**Native point of sale** handles payments well, including contactless, card, and cash.

### Where Fresha Falls Short

- **The 20% commission on new marketplace clients bites at scale.** A $100 service with a new Fresha marketplace client costs you $20. At volume, this exceeds typical monthly subscription costs.
- **Marketing tools are limited** compared to Vagaro's full email/SMS suite.
- **No payroll integration** — Vagaro handles payroll; Fresha requires a third-party solution.
- **Reporting is less comprehensive** for managers wanting detailed business analytics.

## The Pricing Math That Matters

Before choosing, calculate your expected Fresha commission cost:

| Your scenario | Monthly Fresha cost | Vagaro cost (1 provider) |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 2 new clients/month at $80 avg | $32 | $30 |
| 5 new clients/month at $80 avg | $80 | $30 |
| 10 new clients/month at $80 avg | $160 | $30 |

**The crossover point is lower than most people expect.** If you're actively acquiring new clients through a marketplace, Vagaro's flat fee quickly becomes cheaper.

## Final Verdict

**Vagaro wins overall** for full-service salons and anyone with more than one provider. The marketing tools, reporting, memberships, and predictable pricing make it a more complete business platform.

**Fresha wins for soloists and minimalists** — single operators or small studios who want a clean booking system at zero monthly cost and don't rely on marketplace-driven new client acquisition.

**The math doesn't lie:** if you're acquiring 3+ new clients per month at average ticket prices, Vagaro's monthly fee is likely cheaper than Fresha's commissions.
