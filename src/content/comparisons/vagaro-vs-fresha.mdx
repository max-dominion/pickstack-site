Vagaro and Fresha are two of the most popular salon booking platforms in the world — and they're almost always compared side by side. Both handle appointments, staff scheduling, client management, and payments. Both have free options. Both have millions of users.

But their fundamental business models are different in a way that changes everything about how they feel to use and what they actually cost.

**Vagaro** charges a flat monthly subscription fee based on the number of bookable staff. You know what you're paying every month.

**Fresha** has no subscription fee — instead, it charges a percentage on new clients acquired through the Fresha marketplace (not returning clients). That sounds free until you're acquiring a lot of new clients.

Understanding that distinction is the key to choosing between them.

## Vagaro Overview

Vagaro has been in the salon software market since 2009 and now serves over 220,000 businesses in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia.

### What Vagaro Does Well

**The platform is genuinely comprehensive.** Vagaro covers appointment booking, POS, staff scheduling, payroll, inventory management, retail point-of-sale, email marketing, SMS marketing, reputation management, memberships, packages, gift cards, and client management — all in one place.

**Marketing tools are a differentiator.** Vagaro's email marketing, automated campaigns, reputation management (review requests), and client retention tools are significantly more sophisticated than Fresha's.

**Vagaro Marketplace** lists your business on Vagaro's consumer app and website, generating new client bookings without a percentage commission structure.

**Predictable pricing** means you know what you're paying. At $30/month for one provider up to $90/month for 7+, the monthly fee doesn't scale dramatically with business success.

**The POS system** is mature and integrates well with hardware — card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners.

**Memberships and packages** — recurring revenue products — are well-implemented and easy to sell at checkout.

### Where Vagaro Falls Short

- Monthly subscription fee can feel expensive for solo operators, especially early on.
- The interface has a slight learning curve compared to Fresha's clean simplicity.
- Processing rates (2.75% card present) aren't the lowest in the market.

## Fresha Overview

Fresha launched in 2015 and rebranded in 2019 when it introduced its marketplace and commission model. It now serves over 100,000 businesses globally.

### What Fresha Does Well

**Zero subscription fee is genuinely attractive.** For solo operators, booth renters, or small studios with tight margins, not paying $30–$90/month matters. Fresha's core software is legitimately free.

**The user experience is notably clean.** Fresha's interface is modern, intuitive, and fast. New staff can learn the basics in minutes.

**Global marketplace reach** is significant. Fresha's consumer marketplace has users worldwide, and surfaces nearby businesses to new potential clients.

**Native point of sale** handles payments well, including contactless, card, and cash.

**Basic reporting** covers the essentials: revenue, appointments, and staff performance summaries.

### Where Fresha Falls Short

- **The commission model bites at scale.** Fresha charges 20% on new clients acquired through the marketplace. A $100 service with a new marketplace client costs you $20.

- **Marketing tools are limited.** Compared to Vagaro's full email/SMS marketing suite, Fresha offers basic automated messages.

- **Memberships and packages** are less sophisticated than Vagaro's implementation.

- **Reporting is less comprehensive** for managers who want detailed business analytics.

- **No payroll integration** — Vagaro handles payroll; Fresha requires a third-party solution.

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### Pricing Model

**Winner: Depends on your situation**

Vagaro's flat monthly fee ($30–$90/month) is predictable and cheaper at scale when you're acquiring many new clients via Fresha's marketplace.

*Do the math for your situation:*
- 5 new marketplace clients/month averaging $80 each = $80 in Fresha commissions
- Vagaro charges $30/month for one provider, with no commissions
- The crossover point where Vagaro becomes cheaper is lower than most people expect

### Marketing & Client Retention

**Winner: Vagaro**

Vagaro's email campaigns, automated follow-ups, SMS marketing, and review management are significantly more powerful. If growing and retaining your client base is a priority, Vagaro's tools make a meaningful difference.

### POS & Payments

**Tie (slight Vagaro edge)**

Both have capable POS systems. Vagaro's POS is more mature with better hardware integration and retail capabilities.

### Reporting & Analytics

**Winner: Vagaro**

Vagaro's reporting is more comprehensive, with better staff performance reports, revenue analytics, and client behavior data.

### Marketplace Exposure

**Tie**

Vagaro has a meaningful US marketplace. Fresha has global reach with very high market penetration in certain regions. Which marketplace benefits you more depends on your location.

### User Experience

**Winner: Fresha**

Fresha's interface is cleaner and faster to learn. If simplicity matters, Fresha wins.

## Who Should Choose Vagaro?

✅ **Full-service salons with 2+ providers** — The per-staff pricing model amortizes across the team, and having marketing, payroll, and membership tools in one platform saves real time.

✅ **Salons actively marketing and growing** — If you're running campaigns, tracking conversions, and building a client retention strategy, Vagaro's tools pay for themselves.

✅ **Operators who want predictable costs** — The monthly subscription eliminates commission surprises.

✅ **Retail-focused salons** — Vagaro's POS and inventory management for retail products is more polished.

---

## Who Should Choose Fresha?

✅ **Solo operators and booth renters** — If you're one person and don't need advanced marketing tools, Fresha's $0/month model is hard to argue with.

✅ **Established salons with mostly returning clientele** — If you rarely acquire new clients through a marketplace, the commission cost is minimal.

✅ **Operators in regions with strong Fresha penetration** — Fresha's marketplace is particularly strong in the UK, Australia, and parts of Europe.

✅ **Simple scheduling operations** — If you need a clean booking system without complexity, Fresha delivers that elegantly for free.

## The Right Question to Ask

Before choosing, calculate your expected Fresha commission cost:

1. How many new clients do you acquire per month through a marketplace?
2. What's your average ticket for a new client?
3. Multiply those two numbers by 0.20.
4. Compare to Vagaro's monthly fee for your staff count.

If your projected Fresha commissions exceed Vagaro's monthly fee, Vagaro is almost certainly the better choice.

---

## Final Verdict

**Vagaro wins overall** for full-service salons and anyone with more than one provider. The marketing tools, reporting, memberships, and predictable pricing make it a more complete business platform.

**Fresha wins for soloists and minimalists** — single operators or small studios who want a clean booking system at zero monthly cost and don't rely on marketplace-driven new client acquisition.

Both are strong platforms. But the pricing model difference is more significant than it looks at first glance — do the math before you commit.
