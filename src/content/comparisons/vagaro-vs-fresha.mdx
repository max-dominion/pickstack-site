Vagaro and Fresha are two of the most popular salon booking platforms in the world — and they're almost always compared side by side. Both handle appointments, staff scheduling, client management, and payments. Both have free options. Both have millions of users.

But their fundamental business models are different in a way that changes everything about how they feel to use and what they actually cost.

**Vagaro** charges a flat monthly subscription fee based on the number of bookable staff. You know what you're paying every month.

**Fresha** has no subscription fee — instead, it charges a percentage on new clients acquired through the Fresha marketplace (not returning clients). That sounds free until you're acquiring a lot of new clients.

Understanding that distinction is the key to choosing between them.

|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Full-service salons wanting all-in-one tools | Solo operators and studios prioritizing low monthly cost |
| **Monthly fee** | $30–$85/month | $0/month |
| **Transaction fees** | Processing fees only (2.75% swipe) | 20% on new clients from marketplace; standard processing on others |

**Choose Fresha if:** You're a solo operator or small studio with low new-client volume and want to minimize fixed monthly costs.

## Vagaro Overview

Vagaro has been in the salon software market since 2009 and now serves over 220,000 businesses in the US, Canada, UK, and Australia. It's built as a full business management platform for salons, spas, barbershops, and fitness studios.

### What Vagaro Does Well

**The platform is genuinely comprehensive.** Vagaro covers appointment booking, POS, staff scheduling, payroll, inventory management, retail point-of-sale, email marketing, SMS marketing, reputation management, memberships, packages, gift cards, and client management — all in one place. For a medium or large salon that wants to manage everything from one dashboard, Vagaro is hard to beat.

**Marketing tools are a differentiator.** Vagaro's email marketing, automated campaigns, reputation management (review requests), and client retention tools are significantly more sophisticated than Fresha's. If you're actively trying to grow and retain clients, these features add real value.

**Vagaro Marketplace** lists your business on Vagaro's consumer app and website, which has a large active user base. This generates real new client bookings without the percentage commission structure.

**Predictable pricing** means you know what you're paying. At $30/month for one provider, $40 for two, up to $90 for 7+, the monthly fee doesn't scale dramatically with business success.

**The POS system** is mature and integrates well with hardware — card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners. Running a retail component alongside services is smooth.

**Customer support** is strong. Phone support, live chat, and an extensive help center are available.

**Memberships and packages** — recurring revenue products — are well-implemented and easy to sell at checkout.

### Where Vagaro Falls Short

- Monthly subscription fee can feel expensive for solo operators, especially early on.
- The interface has a slight learning curve compared to Fresha's clean simplicity.
- Some features (custom branded app, advanced reporting) require higher tiers or add-ons.
- Processing rates (2.75% card present) aren't the lowest in the market.
- Not available in as many countries as Fresha's global marketplace.

## Fresha Overview

Fresha (formerly Shedul) launched in 2015 and rebranded as Fresha in 2019 when it introduced its marketplace and commission model. It's now one of the most widely used salon platforms globally, with over 100,000 businesses and hundreds of millions of appointments booked.

### What Fresha Does Well

**Zero subscription fee is genuinely attractive.** For solo operators, booth renters, or small studios with tight margins, not paying $30–$90/month matters. Fresha's core software — appointments, client management, scheduling, basic POS — is legitimately free.

**The user experience is notably clean.** Fresha's interface is modern, intuitive, and designed for speed. New staff can learn the basics in minutes. The booking flow for clients is smooth and friction-free.

**Global marketplace reach** is significant. Fresha's consumer marketplace has users worldwide, and the algorithm surfaces nearby businesses to new potential clients. For operators in markets with high Fresha usage, this can drive real new business.

**Client management and history** are solid — appointment history, spending history, notes, and preferences are all tracked per client.

**Point of sale** handles payments well, including contactless, card, and cash. Hardware is available.

**Basic reporting** covers the essentials: revenue, appointments, staff performance summaries.

### Where Fresha Falls Short

- **The commission model bites at scale.** Fresha charges 20% on new clients acquired through the marketplace. If you're a growing salon actively acquiring new clients, those commissions add up fast. A $100 service with a new marketplace client costs you $20.

- **Marketing tools are limited.** Compared to Vagaro's full email/SMS marketing suite, Fresha offers basic automated messages. Running structured marketing campaigns is harder.

- **Memberships and packages** are available but less sophisticated than Vagaro's implementation.

- **Reporting is less comprehensive** for managers who want detailed business analytics.

- **Customer support** is primarily ticket-based; getting a human on the phone is harder than with Vagaro.

- **No payroll integration** — Vagaro handles payroll; Fresha requires a third-party solution.

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### Pricing Model

**Winner: Depends on your situation**

Vagaro's flat monthly fee ($30–$90/month) is predictable and cheaper at scale when you're acquiring many new clients.

Fresha's $0/month model is better for solo operators or established salons with mostly returning clientele who don't need to drive many new client acquisitions through the Fresha marketplace.

*Do the math for your situation:*
- If you use Fresha marketplace to acquire 5 new clients/month averaging $80 each, you pay $80 in commissions.
- Vagaro charges $30/month for one provider, with no commissions.
- The crossover point where Vagaro becomes cheaper is lower than most people expect.

### Appointment Booking & Scheduling

**Tie**

Both handle appointment booking, staff scheduling, and calendar management well. Fresha has a slight edge in interface cleanliness. Vagaro has more configuration options for complex scheduling rules.

### Reporting & Analytics

**Winner: Vagaro**

Vagaro's reporting is more comprehensive, with better staff performance reports, revenue analytics, and client behavior data.

### Marketplace Exposure

**Tie**

**Winner: Vagaro**

Vagaro's membership and recurring revenue tools are more sophisticated and easier to manage.

## Pricing Deep Dive

### Vagaro
| Staff Count | Monthly Price |

| 2 providers | $40/month |
| 3 providers | $50/month |
| 4 providers | $60/month |
| 5 providers | $70/month |

Plus processing fees (2.75% card present).

| Monthly subscription | $0 |
| New client (via Fresha marketplace) | 20% commission |

The 20% commission on new marketplace clients is the critical variable. Estimate your new client volume before concluding Fresha is "free."

## Who Should Choose Vagaro?

✅ **Full-service salons with 2+ providers** — The per-staff pricing model amortizes across the team, and having marketing, payroll, and membership tools in one platform saves real time.

✅ **Salons actively marketing and growing** — If you're running campaigns, tracking conversions, and building a client retention strategy, Vagaro's tools pay for themselves.

✅ **Operators who want predictable costs** — The monthly subscription eliminates commission surprises.

✅ **Retail-focused salons** — Vagaro's POS and inventory management for retail products is more polished.

✅ **US-based businesses** — Vagaro's US marketplace presence is strongest in North America.

---

## Who Should Choose Fresha?

✅ **Solo operators and booth renters** — If you're one person and don't need advanced marketing tools, Fresha's $0/month model is hard to argue with.

✅ **Established salons with mostly returning clientele** — If you rarely acquire new clients through a marketplace (most clients are referred or returning), the commission cost is minimal.

✅ **Operators in regions with strong Fresha penetration** — Fresha's marketplace is particularly strong in the UK, Australia, and parts of Europe. If clients in your area use Fresha to find services, the platform is more valuable.

✅ **Simple scheduling operations** — If you need a clean booking system without complexity, Fresha delivers that elegantly for free.

## The Right Question to Ask

Before choosing, calculate your expected Fresha commission cost:

1. How many new clients do you acquire per month?
2. What's your average ticket for a new client?
3. Multiply those two numbers by 0.20.
4. Compare to Vagaro's monthly fee for your staff count.

If your projected Fresha commissions exceed Vagaro's monthly fee, Vagaro is almost certainly the better choice. If you're a solo operator with low new-client acquisition from a marketplace, Fresha may be genuinely cheaper.

---

## Final Verdict

**Vagaro wins overall** for full-service salons and anyone with more than one provider. The marketing tools, reporting, memberships, and predictable pricing make it a more complete business platform. The Vagaro marketplace drives bookings without commission risk.

**Fresha wins for soloists and minimalists** — single operators or small studios who want a clean booking system at zero monthly cost and don't rely on marketplace-driven new client acquisition.

Both are strong platforms. But the pricing model difference is more significant than it looks at first glance — do the math before you commit.
