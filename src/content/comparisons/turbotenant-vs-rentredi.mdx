If you manage your own rentals without a property management company, TurboTenant and RentRedi are two of the most popular software options for independent landlords. Both are designed for self-managing landlords with small to mid-size portfolios. Both handle the core tasks: listings, applications, tenant screening, rent collection, and lease management.

The difference comes down to pricing model and feature depth.

**TurboTenant** offers a genuinely useful free tier and passes screening costs to tenants. It's one of the most widely used platforms for DIY landlords who want professional-grade tenant screening without monthly fees.

**RentRedi** charges landlords a flat monthly fee (starting at $19.95/month) but offers a more complete mobile experience — for both landlords and tenants — and includes maintenance request tracking, live chat support, and built-in lease templates.

## Feature Comparison

### Tenant Screening

This is where TurboTenant genuinely shines. Its screening reports are powered by TransUnion and include:

- Full credit report
- National criminal background check
- Eviction history
- Income verification (optional)

The cost (~$55) is billed to the applicant, meaning landlords pay $0 for screening. For high-turnover properties or landlords screening multiple applicants per vacancy, this is a significant advantage.

RentRedi's screening (also powered by TransUnion) provides comparable data but requires the landlord to cover the cost ($7–$10/screen) or pass it along as an optional add-on. The process is a bit less seamless for applicants.

**Winner: TurboTenant** — stronger screening reports, passed to tenant at no cost to landlord.

---

### Online Rent Collection

Both platforms support ACH bank transfers. RentRedi also supports credit/debit card payments (with a 2.75% processing fee passed to the tenant or landlord).

TurboTenant's rent collection is solid but more basic — it handles recurring payments and tracks rent status, but late fees and reminders require manual intervention in the free tier.

RentRedi's rent collection includes:
- Automated late fee application
- Recurring rent reminders
- Pre-authorization payment holds
- Partial payment controls
- Tenant mobile app for payment tracking

**Winner: RentRedi** — more automated and tenant-friendly rent collection tools.

---

### Mobile App Experience

RentRedi was built mobile-first. Both landlords and tenants have dedicated apps. Tenants can submit maintenance requests with photos, pay rent, and communicate directly through the app. Landlords can manage properties, view applications, and respond to maintenance requests from their phones.

TurboTenant's mobile app is functional but not as refined. It works well for viewing applications and tracking rent, but power users tend to default to the desktop experience for most management tasks.

**Winner: RentRedi** — clear advantage in mobile experience for both landlords and tenants.

---

### Listings and Marketing

TurboTenant auto-syndicates listings to Zillow, Apartments.com, Rent.com, and dozens of other sites. This broad distribution is included free, and listings typically appear within hours.

RentRedi also syndicates to major platforms but with fewer partner sites. Its listing tools are functional, not a standout feature.

**Winner: TurboTenant** — better listing distribution, especially for the price.

---

### Lease Management

Both platforms provide lease templates and e-signature tools. RentRedi includes state-specific templates and a built-in lease builder with customizable clauses. TurboTenant's lease tools are solid but slightly less customizable.

RentRedi also stores signed leases and sends automated renewal reminders — useful for landlords managing multiple lease end dates.

**Winner: RentRedi** — more customizable templates and better renewal tracking.

---

### Maintenance Management

This is a clear RentRedi advantage. Tenants can submit maintenance requests through the tenant portal with photos and descriptions. Landlords can track status, communicate with tenants, and loop in vendors — all within the platform.

TurboTenant handles maintenance communication, but the workflow is simpler and lacks the visual tracking RentRedi provides.

**Winner: RentRedi** — purpose-built maintenance request tracking.

## Who Should Choose Each Platform?

### TurboTenant is right for you if:
- You have 1–5 units and want to spend $0/month
- You prioritize tenant screening quality above all else
- You're a new landlord who wants to try software without commitment
- Your tenants are comfortable paying for their own screening

## Our Recommendation

For most landlords with 1–5 units, **TurboTenant's free plan is hard to beat**. You get professional tenant screening, listing syndication, and basic rent collection for $0/month. Start there, and upgrade only if you hit its limits.

For landlords managing 5+ units or anyone who wants a more complete mobile-first platform, **RentRedi's $144/year plan** makes the math easy. At $12/month for unlimited units, you're getting professional maintenance tracking, better rent automation, and a tenant app that reduces back-and-forth communication.

## FAQ

**Is TurboTenant really free?**
Yes — the free plan covers listings, applications, tenant screening (billed to the applicant), and basic rent collection. The paid tier ($8–$17/month) adds unlimited e-signatures, custom application questions, and priority support.

**Does RentRedi charge per unit or per landlord?**
Per landlord account. You pay one flat monthly rate regardless of how many units you manage — making it increasingly cost-effective as your portfolio grows.

**Can tenants use RentRedi to pay rent?**
Yes. RentRedi has a dedicated tenant mobile app where tenants can pay rent, submit maintenance requests, and receive communications from the landlord.

**Which platform is better for tenant screening?**
TurboTenant. Its TransUnion-powered reports are comprehensive (credit, criminal, eviction, income), and the cost is charged to the applicant — not the landlord.

**Can I use both platforms at the same time?**
Technically yes, but it creates data management complexity. Most landlords pick one platform for consistency. If screening is your top priority, start with TurboTenant. If you want the full suite, go with RentRedi.
