## How to Choose the Right Property Management Software

**Start with your portfolio size:**
- 1–5 units: Free tools (TurboTenant, Avail, Innago, Stessa) are excellent starting points
- 5–20 units: Consider RentRedi, Baselane, or TurboTenant Premium for more features
- 20+ units: DoorLoop or Buildium for professional-grade tools

**Prioritize your biggest pain point:**
- Rent collection → TurboTenant or Baselane
- Accounting/taxes → Stessa or Buildium
- Tenant screening → DoorLoop or Buildium
- Mobile management → RentRedi
- Cost → Innago or TurboTenant

**Consider growth:** Starting with a free tool makes sense for beginners, but switching platforms means migrating data. Consider your 2–3 year trajectory before committing.
