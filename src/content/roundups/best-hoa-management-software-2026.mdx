Managing a homeowners association is a thankless job — and it's only getting harder. Between collecting dues from delinquent homeowners, tracking architectural review requests, scheduling vendor work orders, and keeping residents informed, HOA board members often end up drowning in emails, spreadsheets, and sticky notes.

The right HOA management software changes that. It centralizes everything: dues collection, violation tracking, meeting minutes, resident communication, financial reporting. Done right, it turns a part-time board member's nightmare into something manageable — even if you're a volunteer with a day job.

We reviewed eight of the leading HOA board management platforms in 2026. Whether you're a self-managed community of 50 homes or a professional management company handling 50 associations, this guide will help you find the right fit.

**Rating: 4.8/5**

PayHOA is the standout choice for self-managed HOAs that want professional-grade tools without enterprise pricing. Built specifically for the HOA market (not adapted from property management software), PayHOA covers the full spectrum of community management: dues collection, violation tracking, architectural reviews, financial reporting, document storage, and resident communication.

## 3. CINC Systems — Best for Large Management Companies

**Rating: 4.6/5**

CINC Systems is built for scale. If you're a community association management (CAM) company running dozens of associations with hundreds of units each, CINC is designed for exactly that workflow. It's not a self-managed HOA tool — it's enterprise infrastructure for professional management operations.

## 4. HOAStart — Best for Small HOAs on a Budget

**Rating: 4.4/5**

HOAStart is the most accessible entry point for small, self-managed HOAs that need basic community management tools without a significant investment. The free plan covers the core features that most small communities need: a community website, document storage, announcements, and basic resident management.

Paid plans add dues collection, violation tracking, and more robust communication tools at pricing that won't strain a small HOA budget. It won't replace purpose-built accounting software for complex financials, but for communities under 100 units that need to get organized, HOAStart is an excellent starting point.

- Document library and file storage
- Announcement and resident communication tools
- Online dues collection (paid plans)

- Voting and polls

**Pros**
- Free plan is genuinely useful for basic community organization
- Extremely easy to set up — no technical knowledge needed
- Community website builder is a differentiator at this price point
- Good for communities that primarily need communication and document management

**Cons**
- Financial management is basic compared to Buildium or CINC
- Not suitable for professional management companies
- Limited reporting and analytics on lower tiers
- Customer support can be slower than premium platforms

## 5. AppFolio — Best for Large-Scale Community Association Management

**Rating: 4.4/5**

AppFolio Community Manager (built on the same platform as AppFolio Property Manager) brings enterprise-grade community association management tools to large HOAs and management companies. It's particularly strong for master-planned communities, large condo associations, and portfolios with both rental and association-managed properties.

AppFolio's AI-powered features — including automated communications, smart maintenance triage, and performance analytics — make it stand out as the platform most actively investing in next-generation capabilities.

**Key Features**

## 6. Enumerate — Best for Financial-First HOA Management

**Rating: 4.3/5**

Enumerate (formerly known as Tops Software) is one of the longest-tenured platforms in HOA management software, with decades of financial management expertise baked in. If your primary requirement is rock-solid accounting — think complex reserve fund accounting, detailed financial reporting, and AR/AP management — Enumerate deserves serious consideration.

The platform has expanded beyond pure financials to include community portals, maintenance management, and communication tools, but accounting remains its core competency.

**Key Features**

## 7. TownSq — Best for Resident Communication and Engagement

**Rating: 4.3/5**

TownSq flips the HOA software paradigm: instead of optimizing for board and manager workflows, it leads with the resident experience. The result is the most polished homeowner-facing app in the category — residents actually use it, which reduces the phone calls and emails that burn out board members.

The platform covers all the core HOA management functions, but its differentiation is the community app experience. Homeowners can pay dues, submit maintenance requests, participate in surveys, access amenity booking, and communicate with the board through a native mobile app that feels like a consumer product.

**Key Features**
- Native iOS and Android apps for homeowners
- Online dues payment with AutoPay
- Work order and maintenance request tracking
- Violation management
- Amenity and facility booking
- Community announcements and messaging
- Document library
- Board and committee portals
- Surveys and voting
- Package management (for multi-family communities)

**Pros**
- Best resident-facing mobile app in the HOA software category
- High resident adoption rates reduce board member workload
- Amenity booking and package management are standout features
- Clean, modern UI that doesn't feel like a government portal
- Works well for lifestyle-focused communities (resort, 55+, luxury)

**Cons**
- Financial management less deep than Buildium or Enumerate
- Pricing is custom and can be higher than expected
- Less suited for professional management companies with complex portfolios
- Advanced reporting requires higher-tier plans

**Pricing:** Contact sales (typically community size-based)

## 8. VillageManagement — Best for Complex Portfolio Operations

**Rating: 4.1/5**

VillageManagement (formerly Village HMS) is a specialized platform for community association management companies with complex operational needs — think mixed-use developments, large master-planned communities, or portfolios with diverse community types. It's purpose-built for professional managers, not self-managed boards.

The platform's strength is its configurability. Unlike more standardized platforms, VillageManagement can be adapted to handle unusual community structures, complex billing arrangements, and non-standard workflows.

**Key Features**
- Multi-community portfolio management
- Configurable accounting and billing workflows

## How to Choose HOA Board Management Software

Picking the wrong platform is expensive — not just in dollars, but in volunteer hours spent migrating data, re-training board members, and re-communicating with residents. Here's how to make the right call.

### Step 1: Know Your Audience

**Self-managed HOA or professional management company?**

This is the first fork in the road. Most HOA software is built for one or the other — not both.

- **Self-managed boards** → PayHOA, HOAStart, TownSq
- **Professional management companies** → CINC Systems, Buildium, AppFolio, Enumerate, VillageManagement

### Step 2: Count Your Units (and Communities)

- **Under 100 units, single association** → HOAStart (budget) or PayHOA (premium)
- **100–500 units, single association** → PayHOA, TownSq, or Buildium
- **500+ units or multiple associations** → Buildium, AppFolio, CINC Systems, Enumerate

### Step 3: Identify Your Biggest Pain Point

| Pain Point | Best Tool |
|-----------|-----------|
| Chasing delinquent dues | PayHOA, Buildium |
| Complex reserve fund accounting | Enumerate, Buildium |
| Residents never reading announcements | TownSq |
| Managing violations consistently | CINC Systems, Buildium |
| Managing 10+ associations from one dashboard | CINC Systems, AppFolio |
| Getting started on a tiny budget | HOAStart |

### Step 4: Think About Residents

A platform that board members love but residents ignore doesn't solve the problem. Ask: *Will our homeowners actually log into this?*

TownSq and PayHOA consistently earn high resident adoption marks. If you're running a community where homeowner engagement is a problem, weight that heavily in your decision.

### Step 5: Budget Honestly

HOA software pricing has two layers:
1. **Platform cost** — monthly/annual subscription fees
2. **Per-transaction fees** — some platforms take a cut of online payments

PayHOA and HOAStart have transparent flat pricing. CINC, Enumerate, AppFolio, and VillageManagement require a sales call. Budget 2–3x what the sales rep quotes for a realistic total cost including implementation, training, and migrations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between HOA management software and property management software?**

Property management software (like DoorLoop or TurboTenant) is designed for landlord-tenant relationships — rent collection, lease management, tenant screening. HOA management software is built for community association governance — dues assessment, violation enforcement, architectural review, board meetings, and homeowner communication. Some platforms (like Buildium and AppFolio) serve both markets, but the workflows are distinct.

**Can self-managed HOAs use this software without a management company?**

Yes — and that's exactly what PayHOA, HOAStart, and TownSq are built for. Self-managed boards are volunteer-run by homeowners who often have no property management background. The best self-managed HOA software makes it possible to run a professional operation without hiring outside help.

**How much does HOA management software cost?**

Budget-friendly options like HOAStart start free, with paid plans from $25/month. PayHOA runs $60–$160/month for most communities. Enterprise platforms (CINC, Enumerate, AppFolio) require custom quotes and typically cost several hundred dollars per month for a management company, often priced per unit under management.

**Do homeowners need to create accounts to use these platforms?**

Yes, most platforms include a homeowner portal that residents access through a browser or mobile app. Adoption varies — TownSq is known for the highest homeowner engagement. PayHOA's portal is also consistently praised. Enrollment is typically handled by the board or management company during setup.

**What features do I need to manage violations?**

At minimum, look for: photo upload capability, templated violation notices (first warning, second notice, fine schedule), tracking of open vs. resolved violations, and documented communication history. CINC Systems, Buildium, and PayHOA all have robust violation management workflows.

**Can HOA management software handle amenity booking?**

Several platforms include amenity and facility booking tools: TownSq, PayHOA (on higher tiers), and AppFolio all support reserving community amenities like pools, clubhouses, and tennis courts. This feature is especially useful for amenity-rich communities where scheduling conflicts are common.

**Is my data secure?**

All reputable platforms use bank-level encryption for data at rest and in transit, and are typically SOC 2 compliant. Always ask vendors about their data security posture, backup procedures, and what happens to your data if you cancel. Some platforms make data export easy; others make it painful.

---

## The Bottom Line

For most self-managed HOAs, **PayHOA** is the clear choice in 2026 — it's purpose-built for community associations, priced fairly, and delivers the best balance of board tools and resident experience without requiring a management company.

If you're running a professional management operation with multiple communities, **CINC Systems** or **Buildium** should be on your shortlist, with **AppFolio** earning consideration for large-scale operations.

Small HOAs just getting started should check out **HOAStart** — the free plan is genuinely useful, and upgrading is painless as your needs grow.

Whatever you choose, the right software won't just save time — it'll reduce conflict, improve financial transparency, and make being on the HOA board something board members don't dread.
