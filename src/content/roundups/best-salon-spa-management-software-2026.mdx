You didn't get into the beauty industry to manage software. But between appointment booking, no-show protection, processing payments, tracking inventory, running email campaigns, and keeping your team's commission calculations straight — the admin side of running a salon or spa is a full-time job on its own.

The right salon management software changes that equation. It handles the operational layer so you can focus on clients, technique, and growing your business. The wrong tool creates friction at every point: slow checkouts, double-bookings, confused staff, clients who drift away because follow-up never happened.

We reviewed ten of the leading salon and spa management platforms in 2026. Whether you're a solo esthetician working out of a suite or a multi-location spa group, this guide will help you find the right fit.

## 1. Vagaro — Best All-in-One for Full-Service Salons & Spas

**Rating: 4.8/5**

Vagaro is the most popular salon and spa management platform in the US for good reason: it covers more ground than any competitor at a price point that doesn't require a private equity budget. From booking and POS to payroll, email marketing, and a built-in consumer marketplace, Vagaro bundles what most salons need into a single, well-integrated system.

The Vagaro marketplace is a genuine differentiator. When clients search for salons or spas in their area, Vagaro listings appear prominently — new client discovery happens organically without additional marketing spend. For salons still building their client base, this alone can justify the subscription cost.

**Key Features**
- Online booking with branded booking page and widget
- Built-in Vagaro marketplace (consumer discovery)
- Point-of-sale with card processing
- Payroll and staff management with commission tracking
- Inventory management and automated reorder alerts

- Memberships and package management
- Intake forms and digital waivers
- Two-way text messaging with clients
- Gift cards (digital and physical)
- Reporting and business analytics
- Native iOS and Android apps for business and clients

**Pros**
- Exceptional value per dollar — more features than most competitors at comparable pricing
- Vagaro marketplace drives genuine new client discovery
- Staff experience (commission tracking, tip management) is excellent

- Interface can feel busy and overwhelming for new users
- Some advanced features require add-ons (forms, check-in kiosks, premium membership tools)
- Payment processing rates are not the lowest available
- Marketing tools are functional but lack design polish compared to GlossGenius

**Pricing:** $30/month for 1 bookable staff · Scales by number of staff members (1=$30, 2=$40, 3=$50... 7+=$85/month) · Add-ons available for forms, check-in kiosks, and premium marketing

**Best For:** Salons, spas, barbershops, and studios with 1–15 staff members who want a full-featured, all-in-one platform with built-in client discovery.

## 2. Mangomint — Best for Modern Salons That Want a Premium Experience

**Rating: 4.8/5**

Mangomint has built a cult following among salon and spa owners who care deeply about software quality. Where other platforms pile on features, Mangomint relentlessly optimizes for speed and clarity. The result is the fastest, most intuitive salon management interface on the market — staff adoption is nearly frictionless.

The express booking flow is the headline feature: clients can book in as few as two taps on mobile. No account creation required. The checkout experience for front desk staff is similarly optimized — even during a busy Saturday rush, transactions move quickly without fumbling through menus.

**Key Features**
- Industry-leading booking interface (fastest checkout in category)
- Express checkout (clients skip account creation)
- Online booking with real-time availability
- Intelligent scheduling with smart service intervals
- POS with integrated card processing
- Two-way text messaging

## 3. Boulevard — Best for Upscale Client Experience

**Rating: 4.7/5**

Boulevard is the premium salon management platform for businesses that compete on client experience. Built with luxury service providers in mind — high-end blowout bars, med spas, elevated hair salons — Boulevard's precision scheduling and white-glove client journey are unmatched.

The platform's "precision scheduling" engine understands the complexity of multi-service appointments: color + cut + blowout require specific chair time, processing time, and stylist availability coordinated in real-time. Boulevard handles this elegantly where other platforms create gaps or conflicts.

**Key Features**
- Precision scheduling engine (multi-service, multi-staff appointments)
- Online booking with branded client experience
- POS with integrated payments
- Client profiles with preferences, formulas, and service history
- Two-way client messaging (SMS and email)

## 4. Fresha — Best Zero-Cost Option for Solo Operators

**Rating: 4.6/5**

Fresha's model is genuinely different: no subscription fee. Ever. The platform makes money through optional paid features (like marketplace listing boosts and a small commission on new client bookings) and payment processing fees. For solo operators and small studios, the economics are compelling.

The feature set is surprisingly robust for a free platform: booking management, POS, client management, inventory tracking, and access to the Fresha consumer marketplace. For high-volume businesses, the per-transaction costs can add up — but for lower-volume solo practitioners, Fresha often wins on total cost.

**Key Features**
- Online booking (no subscription fee)
- Consumer marketplace listing (free, with optional paid boosts)
- POS and payment processing
- Client management and history
- Inventory management
- Email and SMS marketing
- Gift cards and vouchers
- Membership management
- Team management with permissions
- Mobile app for business owners
- Automated appointment reminders

**Pros**
- Zero subscription cost — significant savings for solo operators and small studios
- Consumer marketplace included (with paid boost options)
- Feature-rich for a free platform
- Clean, modern interface that's easy to learn
- Good mobile app

**Cons**
- Commission on new client bookings from marketplace (12.5% for first booking from new clients)
- Payment processing rates not always competitive vs. flat-fee platforms
- Advanced marketing features require paid add-ons
- Customer support can be inconsistent — limited phone support
- Some features feel less polished than premium competitors

**Pricing:** Free (core platform) · Paid features include team notifications, blasts, and marketplace boosts · 12.5% commission on new client bookings via marketplace (one-time per client)

**Best For:** Solo stylists, estheticians, and small studios (1–3 staff) who want professional booking tools with marketplace exposure at the lowest possible monthly cost.

## 5. GlossGenius — Best for Independent Beauty Professionals Who Lead with Brand

**Rating: 4.5/5**

GlossGenius was built for the modern independent beauty professional — the stylist who runs their own Instagram, has a distinct aesthetic, and wants their booking page to match their brand. The platform prioritizes visual polish and a consumer-grade client experience over complex management features.

The branded booking page is the standout: clients get a beautiful, customizable page that looks like it came from a web design agency, not software. For independent stylists who compete on brand and experience, this matters.

**Key Features**
- Beautiful branded booking pages (no-code, highly customizable)
- Online booking with deposit and cancellation policies
- POS with GlossGenius card reader
- Client profiles and notes
- Automated reminders and confirmations
- Text blast marketing to client list
- Gift cards
- Portfolio and media gallery on booking page
- Reporting and income tracking
- Smart reports (income, services, clients)

**Pros**
- Best-looking client-facing booking experience in the category
- Dead simple to set up — operational in under an hour
- Flat-rate payment processing (2.6% + no hidden fees)
- Strong for solo or booth-renting stylists and estheticians
- Built-in portfolio showcases your work alongside booking

**Cons**
- Limited team management features (designed for solo, not teams)
- No built-in consumer marketplace
- Lighter on reporting and business analytics than Vagaro or Mangomint
- Not suited for multi-service spas with complex scheduling needs

**Pricing:** $24/month (monthly) · $20/month (annual)

**Best For:** Independent stylists, estheticians, and solo beauty professionals who want a beautiful, branded booking experience with simple POS and client management.

## 6. Booksy — Best for Discovery-Driven Bookings and Barbershops

**Rating: 4.4/5**

Booksy built its audience in the barbershop market and has expanded to cover salons, spas, and wellness providers. Its consumer discovery network is one of the largest in the beauty industry, and for businesses that depend on walk-in and new client traffic, being on Booksy is increasingly table stakes.

The platform is particularly strong for high-volume, appointment-driven businesses with diverse service menus — think a busy barbershop running 6 barbers with varying service types and durations. Booksy handles that complexity without breaking down.

**Key Features**

## 7. Square Appointments — Best for Businesses Already in the Square Ecosystem

**Rating: 4.3/5**

If your salon already runs on Square — using Square POS for retail, Square Payroll for staff, or Square Marketing for campaigns — Square Appointments is the path of least resistance. It integrates natively with the Square ecosystem and eliminates the friction of connecting separate systems through third-party integrations.

For solo stylists, Square Appointments' free plan is genuinely useful. For teams, it's a solid mid-market option that punches above its weight when combined with Square's broader business tools.

**Key Features**

- Seamless integration with Square's ecosystem (POS, Payroll, Marketing)
- Hardware options (iPad stands, card readers) are polished and widely available

## 8. Schedulicity — Best for Budget-Conscious Solo Practitioners and Wellness Providers

**Rating: 4.2/5**

Schedulicity is one of the most reliable, no-frills booking platforms available for solo beauty and wellness professionals. It won't wow you with AI-powered features or premium design — but it works, it's affordable, and it doesn't waste your time with complexity you don't need.

The Schedulicity marketplace gives small service providers basic discovery exposure. The flat monthly price makes budgeting simple. For solo practitioners crossing the bridge from phone/text bookings to online scheduling, Schedulicity is a solid, low-risk starting point.

**Key Features**
- Online booking with booking page

## 9. Salonist — Best for Multi-Location Salon Chains

**Rating: 4.2/5**

Salonist is a cloud-based salon management platform designed with multi-location operations in mind. While most salon software treats multiple locations as an afterthought, Salonist's multi-branch management, centralized inventory, and location-level reporting make it a natural fit for growing salon groups and franchise operations.

The platform covers the core salon management toolkit — booking, POS, client management, staff management — and adds the multi-location layer that chains need: centralized reporting across locations, inter-branch inventory visibility, and staff management that works across locations.

**Key Features**
- Multi-location management with centralized dashboard
- Online booking with branded page
- POS with integrated payments
- Inventory management with inter-branch transfers
- Staff management with role-based access
- Client database with visit history across locations
- Membership and package management
- Email and SMS marketing
- Reporting by location and consolidated
- Loyalty program management
- Gift cards

**Pros**
- Multi-location support is first-class, not bolted on
- Centralized inventory management across locations
- Competitive pricing for a multi-location system
- Good reporting with location vs. consolidated views
- Loyalty and membership tools are solid

**Cons**
- Less polished UI than Mangomint or Boulevard
- Mobile app is functional but not best-in-class
- No built-in consumer marketplace

- Limited third-party integrations compared to more established platforms

**Pricing:** Starter $25/month (1 location) · Salon $45/month (1 location, more features) · Enterprise custom pricing for multi-location

## 10. Insight Software — Best for High-Volume Salons with Complex Reporting Needs

**Rating: 4.1/5**

Insight Software has been serving high-volume salons for over 30 years. It's the platform favored by established, full-service salons where deep reporting, robust inventory management, and detailed staff performance tracking matter more than modern design or quick setup.

If you're running a salon doing $2M+ annually with 20 stylists, complex retail inventory, and a need to analyze data at a granular level, Insight's reporting capabilities are unmatched. It won't win on aesthetics — but veteran salon operators often choose it precisely because it knows the industry inside and out.

**Key Features**
- Appointment booking and scheduling
- Comprehensive retail and professional inventory management
- Detailed staff performance and commission reporting
- POS with salon-specific workflows
- Client management with full visit and purchase history
- Membership and service package tracking
- Advanced business analytics and custom reporting
- Payroll integration
- Multi-location reporting

**Pros**
- Deepest reporting and analytics in the salon software category
- Excellent retail and professional inventory management
- Deep understanding of salon industry workflows baked in
- Long track record with high-volume salons
- Strong training and onboarding resources

**Cons**
- Dated interface — feels like it was designed in 2010 (because parts of it were)
- Pricing requires a sales conversation — not transparent
- Learning curve is significant
- Mobile experience lags modern competitors by years
- Overkill for salons with fewer than 8–10 stylists

**Pricing:** Contact sales (typically $100–$300+/month depending on configuration)

**Best For:** Established, high-volume salons with complex inventory, staff, and reporting needs where analytical depth matters more than modern UX.

## How to Choose Salon & Spa Management Software

The right platform depends on your business type, size, and what's currently costing you the most time and money. Here's how to think through it.

### Step 1: Solo or Team?

This is the biggest fork in the road:

- **Solo stylist or esthetician** → GlossGenius, Fresha, Schedulicity, or Square Appointments
- **Team of 2–10 staff** → Vagaro, Mangomint, Boulevard, or Booksy
- **Large operation (10+ staff) or multi-location** → Vagaro, Mangomint, Salonist, or Insight Software

### Step 2: What Do You Compete On?

| If you compete on... | Consider |
|---------------------|----------|
| Brand and aesthetics | GlossGenius, Boulevard |
| Client experience and luxury | Boulevard, Mangomint |
| Price competitiveness / new client volume | Vagaro, Booksy, Fresha |
| Operational efficiency at scale | Mangomint, Vagaro |
| Multi-location consistency | Salonist, Vagaro |

### Step 3: New Clients vs. Retention

**Prioritizing new client discovery?**
Vagaro, Fresha, and Booksy all have built-in consumer marketplaces. If you're building a client base, being listed is valuable.

**Prioritizing retention and loyalty?**
Mangomint, Boulevard, and GlossGenius focus on the quality of the client relationship — automated follow-ups, formula notes, client histories, and personalized communication.

### Step 4: Budget Honestly

| Budget per month | Best options |
|-----------------|-------------|
| $0–$25 | Fresha (free), GlossGenius ($24), Schedulicity ($35) |
| $25–$80 | Vagaro ($30–$85), Square Appointments ($29–$69), Booksy ($30–$50) |
| $80–$200 | Mangomint ($165), Boulevard ($175) |
| $200+ | Boulevard, Insight Software |

Don't forget payment processing rates — they're often the hidden cost that tips the scales. Fresha's model charges per-transaction; others include processing at flat rates.

### Step 5: Assess Your Tech Tolerance

Mangomint and Boulevard reward businesses with staff who adapt quickly to new tools. GlossGenius and Schedulicity are for operators who want something set up in an afternoon and working by the next morning. Insight Software requires patience and dedicated onboarding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the difference between salon management software and a booking app?**

Booking apps (like Calendly) just handle scheduling. Salon management software covers the full business stack: booking, POS/payments, client history, staff management, inventory, marketing, and reporting. If you're running a serious salon or spa business, you need dedicated software — not a general-purpose scheduling tool.

**Can I accept deposits and no-show fees?**

Yes — most platforms in this review support deposit collection and card-on-file policies for cancellation/no-show enforcement. Boulevard, Vagaro, and Mangomint have especially robust no-show protection. For solo practitioners, GlossGenius and Fresha also handle this well. No-show protection alone often pays for the software.

**Do clients need to download an app to book?**

No. All platforms reviewed here offer web-based booking — clients can book from your website, Instagram link, or Google Business profile without downloading anything. Some platforms (Vagaro, Booksy, Fresha) also have consumer apps clients can download for convenience, but it's never required.

**What about GDPR / privacy compliance?**

If you have European clients, check each vendor's compliance posture. US-based platforms like Vagaro and Boulevard have GDPR compliance documentation available. When in doubt, ask the vendor directly and review their data processing agreements before signing up.

**Can I track hair color formulas and service notes?**

Yes — Vagaro, Mangomint, and Boulevard all include client profile fields for formulas, notes, and service history. This is one of the most-requested salon-specific features and all three platforms handle it well. Square Appointments and Schedulicity are more limited here.

**What if I want to sell retail products?**

Vagaro, Mangomint, Boulevard, and Insight Software all have solid retail inventory management. Vagaro's retail tools are particularly strong for salons selling a significant volume of product. GlossGenius and Schedulicity are weaker on the retail/inventory side.

**Is there software for med spas specifically?**

Boulevard has become a popular choice for med spas due to its precision scheduling and premium client experience. AppFolio is also used in med spa contexts. For clinical med spa operations with complex medical charting needs, you may also want to look at dedicated med spa platforms (Aesthetic Record, Vagaro's med spa module) — our review focuses on beauty/wellness, not medical-grade software.

---

## The Bottom Line

For most full-service salons and spas, the decision comes down to three platforms:

- **Vagaro** if you want the best all-in-one value, built-in marketplace, and don't mind a busier interface
- **Mangomint** if you want the best staff experience and booking speed and you drive your own traffic
- **Boulevard** if you're positioning as a premium brand and want the best client-facing experience

Solo stylists and booth renters should start with **GlossGenius** (for brand-conscious operators) or **Fresha** (for zero subscription cost). Small studios already on Square shouldn't overcomplicate it — **Square Appointments** gets the job done.

Whatever you choose, get off the phone/text booking system. Online booking alone — with automated reminders — typically pays for the software cost within the first month through reduced no-shows and time savings alone.
