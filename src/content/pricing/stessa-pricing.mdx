Stessa is one of the few property management tools where the free plan is genuinely useful — not a crippled demo. Here's the full breakdown of what each tier includes, what it actually costs, and when it makes sense to upgrade.

## The Short Answer

**Stessa's free plan covers everything most landlords need.** Unlimited property tracking, automated income and expense categorization, portfolio analytics, and basic tax reporting are all available at zero cost.

**Stessa Pro** adds e-filing, advanced reporting, and lease management for around $20/month.

## Stessa Free Plan — What You Get

Available at no cost, with no property or unit cap:

- **Unlimited property tracking** — no limit on number of properties or units
- **Automated transaction import** — connect bank accounts, mortgage accounts, and credit cards for automatic categorization
- **Income and expense tracking** — auto-categorized to real estate expense categories
- **Portfolio analytics** — NOI, cash-on-cash return, cap rate, and occupancy calculated automatically
- **Tax Package** — Schedule E Worksheet ready for your accountant or TurboTax
- **Rent collection** — online rent payments via ACH (powered by partner)
- **Document storage** — upload and store leases, insurance docs, receipts
- **Mobile app** — iOS and Android

For landlords with 1–10 units who don't file complex taxes independently, the free plan is genuinely complete.

## Stessa Pro — ~$20/month (or ~$180/year)

The paid tier adds convenience and tax filing features:

- **1099 e-filing** — file 1099-NEC forms for contractors and vendors directly from Stessa
- **State tax forms** — state-level tax reporting where applicable
- **Mileage tracking** — automatic mileage log for property-related driving (deductible expense)
- **Custom tags** — organize expenses with custom tags for granular reporting
- **Lease tracking** — track lease terms, expiration dates, and renewal reminders
- **Priority customer support** — faster response times
- **Unlimited collaborators** — add unlimited partners, accountants, or property managers to your portfolio

### Is Pro Worth It?

| If you... | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Have contractors you pay 1099 income | ✅ Pro pays for itself at tax time |
| Drive frequently for property management | ✅ Mileage deduction often exceeds Pro cost |
| Have complex multi-entity tax situations | ✅ State forms + custom tags help |
| Are a W-2 employee with 1-3 rentals | ❌ Free plan is sufficient |
| Just want expense tracking and basic taxes | ❌ Free plan covers it |

## Hidden Costs to Know

**ACH rent collection fees:** Stessa's rent collection is powered by a partner processor. ACH transfers are typically free, but card payments carry a standard processing fee (usually 2.9–3.5%) paid by the tenant.

**No setup fee.** No contracts. Cancel anytime on Pro.

**Free plan stays free forever** — Stessa has not moved core features behind a paywall, unlike some competitors.

## Stessa vs. Alternatives (Pricing Context)

| Tool | Free Tier | Paid Tier |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Stessa** | Full-featured | ~$20/month |
| **Baselane** | Banking + basic tracking | ~$15/month |
| **TurboTenant** | Full landlord management | ~$15/month |
| **Buildium** | No free tier | ~$58/month+ |
| **Landlord Studio** | Limited | ~$12/month |

Stessa's free tier is one of the most generous in the property management software category.

## Who Should Use Stessa?

**Best for:** Real estate investors with 1–50 units who want portfolio-level financial visibility, clean expense tracking, and tax-ready reports without paying for a full property management suite.

**Not ideal for:** Landlords who need tenant screening, maintenance management, or full property management features — Stessa focuses on financial tracking, not full PM.

## FAQ

**Does Stessa have a free trial for Pro?**
Yes — Stessa offers a free trial of Pro features before you commit to paying.

**Can I switch from Pro back to Free?**
Yes. Downgrading to Free keeps your data; you lose access to Pro-only features.

**Does Stessa charge per property or per unit?**
Neither. The free and Pro plans are flat — unlimited properties and units at a single price.

**Is Stessa safe for banking information?**
Stessa uses bank-level encryption and connects to financial accounts via Plaid (a widely trusted financial data platform used by most major fintech apps).
