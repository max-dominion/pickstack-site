Buildium is a subscription-based property management platform with tiered pricing based on the number of units you manage. Here's the full breakdown of what each plan includes, how the per-unit costs scale, and what hidden fees to watch for.

## The Short Answer

Buildium has three main tiers: **Essential, Growth, and Premium.** Pricing scales with your unit count. The Essential plan starts at around $58/month for up to 150 units and covers the core PM workflow. Growth and Premium add analytics, open API access, and advanced reporting.

Most property managers in the 50–300 unit range use Essential. Larger managers or those with complex reporting needs gravitate toward Growth or Premium.

## Add-On Fees to Know About

Buildium charges for several features that some competitors include in base pricing:

- **Tenant screening** — Credit, background, and eviction reports are charged per screening (~$15–$30 depending on report type). Can be charged to tenant or landlord.
- **ePayments** — ACH rent collection is included. Same-day ACH is an add-on.
- **eSignatures** — Included in Growth and Premium; add-on on Essential.
- **Buildium Residents App** — Free for tenants.
- **Premium messaging add-on** — Two-way SMS between managers and tenants (add-on fee).

## Is Buildium Worth the Price?

**For professional property managers: yes.** Buildium's accounting, owner portals, and leasing workflows are purpose-built for PM companies managing properties on behalf of owners. The owner portal alone — professional statements, real-time dashboards — justifies the subscription cost if you're managing for clients.

**For DIY landlords managing their own properties:** Probably overkill. TurboTenant, Stessa, or Baselane will cover your needs at a fraction of the cost.
