Buildium is one of the most widely used professional property management platforms. But its pricing is more complex than most competitors — it charges a base monthly fee *plus* a per-unit cost. Understanding both is essential before committing.

## The Short Answer

Buildium charges a **base monthly fee** (varies by plan) plus a **per-unit fee** for each property you manage. Costs start at ~$58/month for small portfolios on the Essential plan and scale quickly as you add units.

There is **no free tier.** All plans require a subscription.

## Per-Unit Pricing (Important)

In addition to the base monthly fee, Buildium charges a **per-unit fee** that varies by plan:

| Plan | Base price | Per-unit fee |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Essential | ~$58/month | ~$0.80–$1.25/unit/month |
| Growth | ~$183/month | ~$0.80–$1.25/unit/month |
| Premium | ~$375/month | ~$0.80–$1.25/unit/month |

> *Exact per-unit rates are volume-tiered and negotiable for larger portfolios. Request a quote for accurate pricing at your unit count.*

### Real-Cost Examples

| Portfolio size | Essential | Growth | Premium |
|---------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 20 units | ~$83/month | ~$208/month | ~$400/month |
| 50 units | ~$120/month | ~$245/month | ~$438/month |
| 100 units | ~$183/month | ~$308/month | ~$500/month |
| 200 units | ~$308/month | ~$433/month | ~$625/month |

## Add-On Costs

Beyond the base subscription + per-unit costs, Buildium has several paid add-ons:

**Tenant Screening** — TransUnion credit/background/eviction reports billed per screening (typically $15–$45/report, depending on who pays).

**eLease Signing (Essential)** — The Essential plan includes a limited number of eLeases per month; additional eLeases cost extra.

**Buildium Renters Insurance** — Optional insurance marketplace (commission-based, not a direct cost to you).

**Payment Processing** — ACH is typically free; card payments carry a processing fee.

**EFT Owner Payments** — Available on Growth and above. May carry a per-transaction fee.

## Buildium vs. Alternatives (Pricing Context)

| Tool | Starting price | Per-unit fee | Free tier |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Buildium** | ~$58/month | Yes (~$1.25/unit) | No |
| **AppFolio** | ~$1.49/unit/month (min $298) | Per-unit only | No |
| **Rent Manager** | Contact for quote | Per-unit | No |
| **TurboTenant** | Free | No | Yes |
| **Stessa** | Free | No | Yes |

Buildium occupies the professional mid-market tier. It's more affordable than AppFolio and Rent Manager for smaller portfolios, but meaningfully more expensive than free-tier tools like Stessa and TurboTenant.

## Who Should Use Buildium?

**Best for:**
- Professional property managers handling 20+ units
- Property management companies (not just solo landlords)
- Portfolios that need full operational workflows: maintenance, inspections, owner disbursements, and financial reporting
- HOA and association management (Buildium has dedicated HOA features)

**Not ideal for:**
- Landlords with 1–5 units who don't need professional PM workflows
- Anyone price-sensitive at small portfolio sizes (free tools like Stessa or TurboTenant are significantly cheaper and may cover needs)

---

## FAQ

**Does Buildium charge per unit or per property?**
Per unit. A 10-unit apartment building counts as 10 units, not 1 property.

**Is Buildium's pricing negotiable?**
For larger portfolios (100+ units), Buildium's sales team typically negotiates volume pricing. Worth asking if you're at that scale.

**Can I start on Essential and upgrade later?**
Yes. You can upgrade between plans without losing data. Downgrading is also possible (you'd lose access to higher-tier features).

**Does Buildium have a setup fee?**
No mandatory setup fee, though professional onboarding services are available for an additional cost.
