Vagaro is one of the most feature-rich salon and spa management platforms available, used by over 220,000 businesses. Its pricing is straightforward: a flat monthly fee that scales with the number of bookable service providers on your account. Here's the full breakdown.

## The Short Answer

**Vagaro charges a flat monthly fee based on the number of bookable staff.** Plans start at $30/month for a single provider and cap at $85/month for 7+ providers — no per-booking commissions, no hidden usage fees.

There is no free plan. Vagaro offers a **free 30-day trial** with full features.

## Vagaro Monthly Pricing by Staff Count

| Bookable Staff | Monthly Price |
|---------------|--------------|
| 1 (solo) | $30/month |
| 2 | $40/month |
| 3 | $50/month |
| 4 | $60/month |
| 5 | $70/month |
| 6 | $80/month |
| 7+ | $85/month |

**Important:** "Bookable staff" means staff who can receive online bookings — not all employees. Administrative staff who don't take appointments don't count toward this limit.

For large salons with 7+ providers, the price caps at **$85/month** — making Vagaro exceptionally affordable per-provider for growing teams.

## What Every Plan Includes

All Vagaro plans (regardless of staff count) include:

- **Online booking** — client-facing booking page, 24/7
- **Appointment scheduling** — calendar management, recurring appointments
- **Client management** — client profiles, notes, visit history, intake forms
- **Point of sale** — service and product sales, checkout
- **Email marketing** — send marketing emails to your client list
- **SMS marketing** — text message campaigns
- **Automated reminders** — appointment confirmations and reminders (reduces no-shows)
- **Reputation management** — automated review request emails post-appointment
- **Inventory management** — track retail products and supplies
- **Staff commission tracking** — calculate commissions by service or product
- **Membership and packages** — create and sell memberships, packages, gift cards
- **Vagaro Marketplace listing** — your business listed on the Vagaro consumer app
- **Reporting** — revenue, staff performance, client retention, inventory

No core feature is locked behind a higher plan tier. Adding more bookable staff just increases the monthly rate.

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

**Processing fees:** Vagaro's 2.75% card present rate is competitive but not the lowest in the market. At high revenue volumes, the difference between processors adds up.

**Add-on stacking:** Forms ($10) + Check-In ($10) + basic payroll can push your effective monthly cost significantly higher than the base subscription.

**No free plan.** After the 30-day trial, you must subscribe to continue using Vagaro.

## Who Should Use Vagaro?

**Best for:**
- Full-service salons and spas with 2–15+ staff
- Solo operators who want comprehensive tools (marketing, memberships, inventory) at a low price
- Salons actively growing their client base (strong marketing tools)
- US-based businesses (Vagaro's marketplace is most active in North America)

**Not ideal for:**
- Solo operators who only need basic booking (GlossGenius or Fresha may be simpler and cheaper)
- Medspas or aesthetic clinics needing EMR/medical charting (Boulevard has better support)
- UK/European operators where Fresha or Booksy may have stronger marketplace presence
