TurboTenant's pricing model is simple in concept but has some nuances worth understanding before you commit. Here's the full breakdown.

## The Short Answer

**TurboTenant is free for landlords.** The company makes money by charging tenants for screening reports and optional services — not landlords.

## Free Plan — What You Get

Everything a typical small landlord needs:

- **Unlimited listings** on Zillow, Trulia, Hotpads, Zumper, Apartments.com, and more
- **Rental applications** — unlimited, online, customizable
- **Tenant screening** — TransUnion credit, background, and eviction checks (paid by applicant, ~$45)
- **Online rent collection** — ACH bank transfer, free for both parties
- **Maintenance request portal** — tenants submit, you track
- **Lease storage** — upload and store any lease document
- **Landlord bank account** — FDIC-insured, auto-separates security deposits

## Premium Plan — $15/month (or $119/year)

The paid tier adds convenience features, not core functionality:

- **E-sign leases** — DocuSign-powered lease signing built in
- **Unlimited custom lease templates** — create reusable lease templates
- **Auto late fees** — automatically charge late fees based on your rules
- **Priority support** — faster response times
- **Remove application fee** — option to absorb the $35 applicant fee yourself

## What Tenants Pay

- Tenant screening report: ~$45 (one-time per application)
- ACH rent payment: free
- Card payment: 3.49% fee (optional, paid by tenant)

## Is the Premium Plan Worth It?

For most landlords with 1–5 units: **no**. The free tier covers everything you actually need.

The premium plan makes sense if:
- You do frequent lease renewals and want e-sign built in (saves DocuSign fees)
- You manage 10+ units and want auto late fees to run automatically
- You want to attract higher-quality applicants by covering the screening fee yourself

## How TurboTenant Compares

| Feature | Free | Premium ($15/mo) |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| Listings syndication | ✓ | ✓ |
| Online applications | ✓ | ✓ |
| Tenant screening | ✓ | ✓ |
| Rent collection (ACH) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Lease e-signing | ✗ | ✓ |
| Auto late fees | ✗ | ✓ |
| Custom lease templates | 1 | Unlimited |

## Bottom Line

TurboTenant's free plan is genuinely useful — not a crippled demo. For most landlords, it's all you'll ever need. The $15/month premium plan is a reasonable upgrade if you're scaling beyond 5–10 units.
