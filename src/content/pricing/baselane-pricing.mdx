Baselane's pricing model is different from most property management software: the core product is banking, and the banking is free. You pay for premium features on top, not for the base product. Here's exactly how it works.

## The Short Answer

**Baselane's banking is free.** No monthly subscription, no minimum balance. The FDIC-insured landlord bank account, rent collection, and basic expense tracking cost nothing.

Baselane Plus (~$15/month) adds advanced rent collection features, automated bookkeeping rules, and priority support. Baselane Pro adds portfolio-level analytics and multi-entity support.

## Free Plan — What You Get

Baselane's free tier includes the core banking infrastructure most landlords actually need:

- **FDIC-insured landlord checking account** — unlimited properties on one account
- **Virtual property accounts** — separate sub-accounts per property for clean bookkeeping
- **Virtual debit cards per property** — one card per property for expense separation
- **Online rent collection (ACH)** — tenants pay online; money lands in your Baselane account
- **Automatic transaction categorization** — transactions tagged to property and expense category
- **Real-time balance and transaction history**
- **Basic income and expense reports**
- **Tenant management basics** — record tenants, leases, and due dates
- **High-yield savings** — competitive APY on your reserve balances
- **Mobile app** (iOS and Android)

---

## Baselane Plus — ~$15/month

For landlords who want more automation and advanced collection tools:

- **Automated late fee collection** — charge late fees automatically without manual intervention
- **Custom payment schedules** — partial payments, split payments, and custom due date rules
- **Automated bookkeeping rules** — auto-tag recurring transactions with custom rules
- **Maintenance request tracking** — tenants submit requests; you track and respond
- **Priority customer support**
- **Plaid bank linking** — connect external accounts for unified tracking

---

## Baselane Pro — Pricing on request

For operators managing multiple entities or larger portfolios:

- **Multi-entity management** — manage multiple LLCs or ownership entities from one login

## Transaction Fees

- **ACH rent collection:** Free for landlords. Tenants pay no fee for ACH.
- **Card payments:** Tenants can pay by credit/debit card; a processing fee applies to the tenant.
- **Wire transfers:** Standard wire fees apply.
- **ATM fees:** Baselane reimburses ATM fees on qualifying balances.

---

## What Baselane Doesn't Include (At Any Tier)

- **Full general ledger accounting** — Baselane tracks income and expenses but isn't double-entry bookkeeping software. Many landlords use Stessa alongside Baselane for deeper analytics.
- **Tenant screening** — No credit or background check tools. Use TurboTenant or RentRedi for screening.
- **Leasing and listing syndication** — Baselane is a banking/tracking tool, not a full property management platform.

---

## Is Baselane Plus Worth $15/Month?

**For most landlords: probably not immediately.** The free banking tier is genuinely capable. Upgrade if you want:

- **Automated late fees** — saves time if you manage 5+ units
- **Maintenance tracking** — consolidated request management
- **External bank linking** — if you maintain non-Baselane accounts you want to track

---

## Can You Use Baselane Alongside Other Tools?

Yes — and many landlords do. Common combinations:

- **Baselane + Stessa**: Use Baselane for banking and rent collection, connect the account to Stessa for deeper investment analytics and tax prep
- **Baselane + TurboTenant**: Use TurboTenant for listings, applications, and screening; Baselane for banking and collections
- Both tools have free tiers, so the combination costs nothing

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Baselane FDIC-insured?**
Yes. Baselane accounts are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 per depositor through Thread Bank.

**Does Baselane have a minimum balance?**
No minimum balance required. There are no monthly maintenance fees on the free tier.

**Can I have multiple property accounts?**
Yes. Baselane's virtual account structure lets you create separate sub-accounts for each property — all visible from one dashboard.

**Does Baselane report to credit bureaus?**
No — this is a landlord banking product, not a business credit card.

**Can my property LLC use Baselane?**
Yes. Baselane supports individual owners and LLCs. Multi-entity support (multiple LLCs) requires the Pro tier.
