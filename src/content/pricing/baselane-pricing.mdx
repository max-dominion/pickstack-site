Baselane is one of the more unusual tools in the property management space: it leads with landlord banking (a real FDIC-insured bank account), and the property management features are built around that banking core. Here's what each pricing tier includes and when you actually need to upgrade.

## The Short Answer

**Baselane's core banking and rent collection are free.** You can open an account, collect rent, and track expenses at zero cost.

**Baselane Plus** (~$15/month) adds lease management, advanced reporting, and a few workflow automations.

## Baselane Free — What You Get

Everything a landlord needs to bank and collect rent:

- **FDIC-insured landlord banking** — dedicated business checking accounts (up to 20 per property)
- **Virtual cards per property** — issue dedicated debit cards to separate property expenses
- **Online rent collection** — ACH bank transfers, with optional credit/debit card payments
- **Automatic income and expense categorization** — transactions auto-tagged to real estate categories
- **Basic financial reporting** — income statements, expense summaries
- **Unlimited properties and units** — no unit cap on the free plan
- **Tenant portal** — tenants pay online, submit maintenance requests
- **High-yield savings** — competitive APY on your rental reserves and security deposits

### What Makes the Free Plan Genuinely Useful

The FDIC-insured banking is the key differentiator. Unlike connecting an external account to a tracking tool, Baselane *is* your bank account — and it's purpose-built for rental income. Every dollar that flows through is automatically categorized to the right property and expense type.

## Baselane Plus — ~$15/month (or ~$120/year)

The paid tier adds operational management features:

- **Lease management** — store and track lease agreements, terms, and expiration dates
- **Lease renewal automation** — reminders when leases are approaching expiration
- **Advanced financial reports** — more detailed profit/loss, cash flow, and tax-ready reports
- **Bulk rent collection** — apply one-click late fee charges across multiple units
- **Priority customer support**
- **Automated late fees** — configure late fee rules that apply automatically

### Is Plus Worth It?

| If you... | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Have multiple leases to track with varying end dates | ✅ Lease management is valuable |
| Want automated late fees | ✅ Saves manual work at scale |
| Need detailed tax reporting | ✅ Advanced reports worth it |
| Are banking with Baselane and just collecting rent | ❌ Free plan is sufficient |
| Have 1–3 units and manage informally | ❌ Free plan covers it |

## Hidden Costs and Fees

**ACH rent collection:** Free for both landlord and tenant on standard ACH transfers.

**Card payments:** If tenants pay by credit/debit card, there's a processing fee (typically 2.9–3.5%) — this is typically passed to the tenant or absorbed by the landlord.

**Wire transfers:** Standard wire transfer fees apply (usually $15–25 outgoing).

**No setup fee, no per-unit fee, no minimum balance requirement** on the checking account.

## Baselane vs. Alternatives (Pricing Context)

| Tool | Core price | Banking | Rent collection | Tax reporting |
|------|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Baselane** | Free | ✓ Built-in | ✓ Native | Basic |
| **Stessa** | Free | ✗ Connect external | ✓ (partner) | Excellent |
| **TurboTenant** | Free | ✓ Partner | ✓ Native | Basic |
| **Landlord Studio** | Free / $12+ | ✗ | ✓ | Good |

Baselane's differentiation is the banking product. If you want a dedicated landlord bank account where income and expenses are automatically categorized and separated by property, Baselane's free plan is hard to beat.

## Who Should Use Baselane?

**Best for:**
- Landlords who want a dedicated landlord bank account (not just a tracker connected to a personal account)
- Landlords collecting rent online who want everything in one place
- New landlords setting up financial infrastructure from scratch
- Landlords who want to earn yield on security deposits and capital reserves

**Not ideal for:**
- Landlords who primarily need deep portfolio analytics and investor-level reporting (Stessa is better for this)
- Landlords who need full property management features: tenant screening, maintenance management, detailed lease management (dedicated PM tools cover this better)

---

## A Common Combination

Many landlords use both Baselane and Stessa: Baselane for banking and rent collection, Stessa connected to the Baselane account for deeper tracking and tax reporting. Both have free tiers, so there's no cost to running both.

## FAQ

**Is Baselane a real bank?**
Baselane banking is FDIC-insured up to $250,000, provided through Thread Bank (Member FDIC). It's a real bank account, not a virtual wallet.

**Does Baselane have a minimum balance?**
No minimum balance required on the free checking account.

**Can I have multiple Baselane accounts?**
Yes — you can create up to 20 virtual accounts per property, all within one Baselane account. Useful for separating operating funds from security deposits.

**Does Baselane file taxes for me?**
No. Baselane provides reports you can use at tax time, but doesn't file taxes directly. For automated Schedule E prep, Stessa has more depth.
